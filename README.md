# TODO
1. Term frequency, entity = parse company names, people (pre-trained)

2. What big words are being used?

3. Training classification models ==> knime; fuzzy match, keyword search

4. Error correction, catch error

5. Frontend - so that everyone can use

6. Work on Readme = explain, add comments

7. Fix export so that you get CSV with specific name

8. Think about what is the effect? Business impact - competitive intellignece, audience intelligence; improvement on Sprinklr
