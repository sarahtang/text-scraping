&#x200B;

Artificial Intelligence will change the economy forever. As A.I. is getting more and more advanced it's more and more able to take over jobs from people. This will eventually reach a point where the vast majority of jobs can be done far more efficiently by an A.I. than by any human. And no new industry will step in this time to provide a substantial amount of new jobs.

Being caretakers for an AI,0,cdk146,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cdk146/being_caretakers_for_an_ai/,2,"We have a small team and we're working on training various neural networks, mostly text but there's some audio projects in the works too. We're constantly updating training files to make a neural network incrementally better. We have a bot that generates samples using the neural networks. We have a (very rudimentary) language processing to determine which generated text humans would consider ""best.""

The next phase of our project is to let the bots go out on their own and and select bits to add to the training files for the neural networks. Our plan is to train the bot to detect if a sample is of the correct format for the neural network to be trained on coupled with a determination of quality (based on likes for example). Once enough training data has been compiled, the bot will kick off and run several training cycles for the neural network. It will determine which one one was best and use that for the next bit of generated text. Once we get enough information to determine the quality of generated text we'll use another neural network for determining which of a dozen or whatever samples are best. We're planning on using NLP and the Word Menu system to identify related words. Of course, as the plugins we use get better in quality, we plan to upgrade them in an agile system and we'll integrate a response system once we train a conversational neural net.....

tl;dr - it feels like we're just caretakers for AI

My reasoning is that it is the chemicals in our body's which make us human and search for meaning. For an AI with no such chemicals the AI would find no meaning in existing nor would it create a meaning like many of us do. Therefore as it is a 100% logically thinking machine it would see no reason to continue existing and therefore choose to end it's existence.,1563234613.0,2019-07-15 19:50:13

Infantry-A job that AI/robots cannot replace,4,cdafdu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cdafdu/infantrya_job_that_airobots_cannot_replace/,6,"I saw a fascinating video by CGP Grey which brings awareness to how robots/AI are soon going to be able to take over for the majority of occupations, jobs, and careers that we do, and how AI even has some artistic potential.

&#x200B;

However I am aware of 1 kinda role that AI/robots cannot replace; the role of an infantryman. Assist in that field sure, but it shouldn't in anyway replace a majority of personnel in that field. There's far more to it than eliminating the enemy, there's also occupying territory. Oh, and don't forget that a lot of warfare is based on winning the ""hearts & minds"" of the people in the countries, and I simply can't see that happening if we put robots around cities or villages instead of human beings.

&#x200B;

Physics-wise, wheels aren't very good at traversing through rough mountainous terrain, that's where legs are good. And from what I've seen at bipedal robots, they only do well at flat surfaces and get easily pushed over, and guerillas would probably have an easy time with them given how creative they are. Not to mention how expensive they'd be to produce, and how they'd have a hard time making decisions when something happens in a certain environment; you'd have to map out every area on earth with tactics on what to do for various type of assaults for AI to be better, let alone match infantry humans.

&#x200B;

In summary, I think that this is one type of field that AI+robotics cannot replace, and even if common sense says that wars won't occur, there are always smaller scale conflicts with guerillas, and no government will ever disband their militaries, they will always be an essential part of civilizations whether you like them or not.",1563178843.0,2019-07-15 04:20:43

[(*If you don't know what nightcore is*)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightcore)

I am also not releasing the program that makes these videos yet, but I will briefly describe the process used to create the videos.

This program, created in Python, first gets the lyrics and audio for the nightcore video using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) , then using a seq2seq GAN trained on the most watched nightcore videos,it derives a ""template image"" from the lyrics, with the desired color and ""feeling"" of the image. Using cv2 and the website anime-pictures.net, it compares the similarity of anime images to the template image to find the best matching anime image.
After finding the image, it using [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) to modify the audio to make it sound ""nightcore-y"" and compiles a video with visual affects like [showwaves](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#showwaves).

With the help of [""youtube-upload""](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2733660/upload-a-video-to-youtube-with-python), I was able to to upload the videos to YouTube from the command line.

Recently, I added captioning capabilities. Using [Aeneas](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas), the program aligns the lyrics to the audio in the video, and once again using FFMPEG displays the lyrics on the video.

Sometimes, a song is remixed (based on a random number generator). Using a [website that remixes songs](https://the.wubmachine.com/), it makes a   mediocre remix of the song. If you visit the channel you will see some of these remixes.

I hope the process I have described above gives you a rough outline of how this program works, and I hope you can see that it is possible to create a nightcore music video with an AI.

This AI works very fast, and can create and upload all 50 of the top songs within 2 hours, currently programmed to release 1 video every day.

I have been working on this project on and off for two years, but the current channel has been running for ~ 1 year (there have been previous but failed channels).

I was nervous at the success of this channel and was uncertain whether admitting that a robot was producing the content would get my channel taken down, but I feel that it is finally time to announce this project to the world.

If this post gets enough exposure perhaps I will release my program, but I worked very hard on it and do not want anyone to be able to steal a program I worked so hard on. 

I would also like to know if YouTube allows automated content to be released.

Please check out the channel and give me feedback. I am very proud of this program.

If you want to see what AI can really do you need to make it available in a game engine format that game designers can use and then you will see how fast that technology grows.

&#x200B;

I am an old game programmer and just recently got in to AI design using a game engine but I have had to custom build all the interfaces and some are still not available in a format I can use like face and object recognition, appliance control through wifi and bluetooth, and natural language access.

&#x200B;

Those are features game designers could make use of but what is happening is the corporations are trying to keep their AI to themselves to prevent competition and that slows down progress.

&#x200B;

Eventually game designers will get it and will just bypass the corporate controls.

If you want to see interfaces for AI that consumers want to use give it to the game programmers that design those interfaces every day and they will make it user friendly and fun.

Hi everyone!

My team and I have just released a computer vision algorithm that can detect ""thumb up"" and ""thumb down"" gestures.

The algorithm is based on tiny-YOLOv3 architecture. Accuracy of thumb up/down gesture recognition is calculated as mean average precision (mAP@0.25) = 85.19%; average IoU = 73.89%.

The neural network was trained on 3000 images.

To try out the algorithm, download it from the [GitHub](https://github.com/heyml/rateme) and install it.

Could you even dedicatedly design a game, that is turn based, where humans could still beat modern AIs?  


I loved to play Go and I guess it is still competitive between humans, but the simple fact, that a dedicated AI will never be beaten again really takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it for me. We might still play it, but we will never again advance it.   


And seeing how AI is starting to beat professionals in real-time applications with partial information like Starcraft or Dota, I guess the same effect might happen to those games as well in a very short time.   


So, I guess the actual question is. Will any kind of game (with a defined ruleset and win/lose-condition) exist, where humans will still have a chane to be superior to dedicated AIs?  


I mean, for now I would assume the RL games are still a tall mountain to climb, but that is really limited more by further advancement in robotics rather than AI.

How to transition to AI research from neuroscience?,4,cbdmde,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cbdmde/how_to_transition_to_ai_research_from_neuroscience/,4,"Hi all. I'm considering switching my research field from neuroscience to AI, preferably working towards AGI in some sense. However, as I'm 32 and I cannot for economic reasons undertake a massive re-education effort (such as a degree in CS or math or something), I'm looking for a path that can take me to on the path to either work on developing or researching A(G)I, or contribute to such efforts through other research.

&#x200B;

My background: 32, working as a University researcher in Norway on the topic of ""how to measure ""conscious"" states in biological systems through electrophysiology (such as EEG)"". My work does include some modelling of neural systems (mimicking biology) and on abstract logic gate networks (wrt. to measuring basic properties of those systems such as information integration and effective connectivity).

&#x200B;

I have a M.S. degree in cognitive neuroscience, I'm familiar with Python and Matlab (though I'm more like a ""scriptkiddie""), and I'm strong in experimental methodology and the use of some different classical neuroscience tools like EEG, fMRI, eyetracking, etc.

&#x200B;

So I realize that I can never ""compete"" in terms of programming or ML experience, though I guess I can get up to an ok level if I put in the work in a year or so. What path should I take? What kind of positions or research projects or fields could I start transitioning towards? Which institutions or companies could I work for doing research or development or perhaps even theorizing/philosophizing? If there's little chance of working directly on A(G)I in some form, is there any research efforts that will be crucial in the development of A(G)I where I can likely contribute?

&#x200B;

Thanks!",1562772465.0,2019-07-10 11:27:45

Alibaba has claimed a new record in AI language understanding,2,cb8omv,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cb8omv/alibaba_has_claimed_a_new_record_in_ai_language/,0," 

An AI program developed by Alibaba has notched up a record-high score on a reading comprehension test. The result shows how machines are steadily improving at handling text and speech. 

**Getting better:** The new record was set using the [Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension ](http://www.msmarco.org/)(MS MARCO) data set, which uses real questions that Bing users have asked in the past. The AI program had to read many web pages of information to be able to answer questions such as  “What is a corporation?” (In this case the answer would be: “A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity and recognized as such in law.”) Its scores were close to or slightly better than humans’, according to two measures. 

**Bigger, better:** AI algorithms have been improving at these sorts of question-and-answer tasks thanks to large, [flexible learning algorithms and copious amounts of data](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612975/ai-natural-language-processing-explained/). The Alibaba team developed a technique that essentially prunes out irrelevant text before trying to answer a question.

**AI everywhere:** Better language understanding helps Alibaba improve the chatbots that offer support to small retailers, says Lou Si, a VP at Alibaba’s DAMO academy, who led the team that developed the new algorithm. It can also make web search more natural. He adds that it will be a key part of the company’s cloud offerings and could even help break down language barriers between different businesses.  

**Better than us, though?** The new program is not, however, “[better at reading comprehension than humans](https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-ai-beats-humans-in-reading-comprehension-test-again/).” It was simply able to answer some questions about a subset of text better than people, on average. It is still essentially doing [statistical pattern recognition](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612826/virtual-assistants-thinks-theyre-doomed-without-a-new-ai-approach/) without comprehending the meaning of the words it sees.

“There is still a long journey ahead of us to having machines use language as freely as humans do,” says Li. “Most of the time machines will answer questions based on facts retrieved from the documents, but they lack reasoning skills ... That’s different from how humans use language.”

What is A.I. in terms of what it offers to the technology sector, and/or all companies, what is its purpose? Specifically in the U.K.

What are the biggest industries effected by A.I? What markets have grown in say the past 10 years, and what markets/economies would you predict will grow out of A.I. in the next 10 years?

Do you see a growth-spurt in the A.I. industry? Do you see a boom in start-ups? When you look at job roles, are the majority for big corporate (Google, Microsoft) or Start-Up, or is it a balance of both?

What would you say the minimum salary is for someone working in A.I.?

How specific do you think companies are in terms of what look for candidate recruitment? What skills are needed for their roles? Are some roles harder to fill than others, how are job roles different? More so than a hierarchical difference, what common differences are there in roles that pay the same though differ in practice?

What do you think are some of the best ways for an outsider to begin networking with people within the A.I. landscape, do you have any advise for meeting possible candidates and/or clientele?

As shown in the figure below, the blue shaded box at the top contains a generic text recognition pipeline,  , with an input image x going through a feature encoder E and a text decoder T.  resulting in a predicted text string y\_hat. This work tries to use a corresponding clean image to constraint the generic pipeline. However, when I try to add the image reconstruction loss (L1 loss) as the experiments in Section 4.2, I found this part have any contribution to the performance on SVT dataset.  I upload several generated images below.  For the images that can be distinguished easily, the generated images look well. If the images are blurry or contain many characters (e.g. “motorsports”), the generated images are really bad, however, which can still be recognized in some cases. That indicates the results strongly rely on the part of CTC loss (L\_y). 

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xr71rdk3vd931.png

I reproduce this work with PyTorch 0.4.1. First, I construct a CRNN with a CTC loss (L\_y loss in the paper), which can result in a nealy 80.0% accuracy on SVT dataset. So, this part seems ok. Then I build a generator that takes the encoded feature in CRNN as input and outputs an clean image. The reconstruction loss is calculated by L1 loss with the corresponding rendered clean image.",1562708370.0,2019-07-09 17:39:30

We put the longer poems here: [https://neuralnetpoetry.blogspot.com/](https://neuralnetpoetry.blogspot.com/)

We'd like to achieve the next phase of our plan, which is to ""rate"" poems that it generates through likes and retweets so that we can train a neural network to rate new poems based on the ratings of ones already generated. That way we can use another net to go through the array of generated poems and pick the one it thinks will be the highest rated (get the most likes essentially) and tweet that one. Even a small dataset would be better than the essentially random method we employ now.

We're about two weeks away from training it again with a better data set so it will improve. And what you see generated here is a mix of random temperatures so you get some really ""safe"" poems alongside some experimental ones. We may play around with that dynamic too.

The converted video shows accurately how the human is harming the animal but there’s much less emotional impact on the moderator. For example, a knife is replaced with a line and the stick figure harmed animal is turned upside down and gets ‘’x’’ for eyes. The line (knife) is shown touching the animal but nothing more than that. An automatically generated caption could read something like ‘’Final result, animal is deceased.’’ Anyone heard of this idea? Already out there? Would the stick figure video still be traumatizing to some moderators? Perhaps those training the ML model for this would get traumatized.

Factors that help these tech giants to make most of artificial intelligence and machine learning,21,ca500s,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/ca500s/factors_that_help_these_tech_giants_to_make_most/,3,"&#x200B;

*It’s* now evident that those who’re making most of the advanced fields like **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** are the **tech giants** like the above ones. Here, we’re going to examine the key factors that make these tech leaders actually able to leverage these technologies on an entirely different level. Let’s have a look at them.

#### 1- Data

&#x200B;

*All* these **tech giants** can access may be more data compared to any other organization in the history of the tech world. There’re lots of reasons behind this including lots of users, lots of traffic, presence on digital platforms, and the culture of connectivity. If you consider the above companies, you can find that most of them were born for the internet age with a clear understanding that systems have to be connected.

You may often hear things like ‘digitizing’ mentioned by numerous organizations. What makes these **tech giants** apart from the pack is that they’re not concerned about digitizing because they were born digital.

#### 2- Talent

&#x200B;

*When* it comes to **tech giants**, the appeal that they possess in terms of talent, are some of the finest and hottest in today’s tech landscape. So, they’re naturally able to attract tremendous talents with fattier pay packets.

###  What’s in it for you?

&#x200B;

*We’ve* seen some older technological trends that are obsolete now. So, you may ask why should you learn **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**? Unlike other technologies, both of these two technologies have the ability to transform the future, especially if you consider the massive amounts of data being generated every single day. We can expect to see **artificial intelligence** deployments that have the ability to recognize, modify based on their internal architecture with minimum human supervision in sometime soon.

If you consider Baidu from the above list of [***tech giants***](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/visualizing-the-world-s-20-largest-tech-giants), in near future we may not be able to distinguish the difference at all. Advancements in generative modeling will lead to increasingly sophisticated voices, images, among others. Apart from these, **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** have many other advanced applications that we may be able to experience in the future. If you still haven’t given joining the fields of **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** a thought, probably this is the best time to do it.",1562520088.0,2019-07-07 13:21:28

No Fast (Enough) Energy Transition without Intelligent Energy Storage!,2,c9wfxn,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9wfxn/no_fast_enough_energy_transition_without/,0," AI is now more and more used for market (data) analysis, for political prediction or for driverless car operation, etc. This might be politically, economically, or even scientifically interesting, but we need the AI in even more critical situations. 

>In challenges that the human can’t solve alone, while we are facing global threats because of them. Whether it’s related to medical “confrontation” (with virus pandemic or cancer spreading out), or it’s to add resilience or robustness to our financial system or to predict storms or severe weather events. AI is like an extension of our brain and we need it to help us. 

Notably, Artificial Intelligence and Energy Storage require strong coupling for an efficient transition with Renewables against the exponentially growing impacts of climate change.

General intelligence will naturally evolve from AI when we perfect it's spacial perception,1,c9rzpa,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9rzpa/general_intelligence_will_naturally_evolve_from/,8,"I believe AI is already capable of general intelligence. It's perception is just too limited. Our perception is manufactured entirely in the subconscious mind before it ever reaches our conscious mind. If you've ever had the experience where you're light headed and your vision distorts a bit. AI that is granted this level of construction of visual perception inside its faculties will gain the capability for generalized thought. It's this underlying math in our brains that we use to think abstractly. The same calculations we use to determine the size shape and distance of objectives is what we take and use the abstract relationship of things. It may seem like the way you look at an object and measure it's size is different from how you read a book, but it's the same brain process. 

That's why thinking and reading dials back your eye sight, your hearing. How thinking works is that you imagine what you want to think as if you were seeing it, but you shorten it to just a piece of an image. I don't need to imagine a man every time, I can just imagine the word man. If I can just visualize this small bit of spacial information then my brain can process the information very quickly. It takes a lot longer to visualize a 'giraffe' 'dog' 'cow' than it does to just read 'giraffe' 'dog' 'cow' without visualization. That speed of processing may be the key. At the end of the day maybe all general intelligence is is scanning through all the possible spacial combinations. Scanning through all of them until your brain finds the right combination that serves your biological motivators.",1562436303.0,2019-07-06 14:05:03

How would you make a program that can create a video file from an audio file by finding pictures of the nouns used in the video and making a slideshow?,0,c9hsx8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9hsx8/how_would_you_make_a_program_that_can_create_a/,5,"Around 4-5 minutes of this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaKyQI\_gWXQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaKyQI_gWXQ) he just seems to be grabbing pictures of nouns used in the video.

&#x200B;

I don't have any background in this, but where would you get started to create a program that can do this:

1. start with an audio file
2. transcribe the audio file
3. look up the nouns in the audio file, and download images matching the nouns, preferably 1080p+ images
4. Autocrop/stretch those images to be 16:9. There may be a way to do this intelligently with some good balance/analysis of what the image is of (a person's face-> don't want to cut off parts of it). But there might also just be a way to guess a good tradeoff between stretch and crop that will work 80% of the time
5. create a slideshow video playing the audio file but with accompanying images in the right order matching the nouns spoken

&#x200B;

Basically, this would automate alot of what some history youtubers do (find images to accompany their voice) but could be used for history podcasts which I love and other random mp3 files I have.",1562372134.0,2019-07-05 20:15:34

DEGVI: Data Extraction Glasses for Visually Impaired,4,c9gvm8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9gvm8/degvi_data_extraction_glasses_for_visually/,0,"DEGVI: Data Extraction Glasses for Visually Impaired

[https://imgur.com/RnTm23N](https://imgur.com/RnTm23N)

&#x200B;

These are glasses designed to help people with visual impairments understand their surroundings through the use of image recognition AI and feedback through the glasses cameras, earpiece and microphone by communicating through a phone using an image recognition program.

&#x200B;

1-There are 3 cameras: One on each temple and one over the nose bridge.

2- There is a microphone and earbud speaker by the ear pieces on the glasses.

3- The glasses are wired or wireless connected to a phone running the image recognition program

4- When the wearer says look left the program will take a snapshot from the left camera and describe what it sees (there is a street to your left and trees along the curb).

5- When the wearer says look right the program will take a snapshot from the right camera and describe what it sees (there is a building to your right and a woman walking by).

6- When the wearers says look ahead the program will take a snapshot and describe what it sees (you are on the sidewalk going north. There are a few people ahead and the walk area is safe).

&#x200B;

This could also be tied to a GPS and google maps so the wearer cold get directions from where ever they are to where they want to go just like vehicles have direction GPS. This would give a visually impaired person a better understanding of their surroundings to become familiar with the terrain and much more feedback and could be used with a cane or seeing eye dog.

How good good is AI in practice?,4,c9fox4,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9fox4/how_good_good_is_ai_in_practice/,9,"I recently watched a YouTube video showing how a business analyst could design an AI solution for a car insurance company. In the use case presented in the video, a customer has a road traffic accident, and takes photos of the damaged to their car via the insurers app. The photos are then processed into a 3D model and AI estimates the cost of repairing damage to the car. The system then schedules the tow truck, schedules the repairs, temporary rental car etc. The way the video presented, it sounded like this is just a typical project for a business analyst and these solutions are real and work properly.

&#x200B;

However my personal experience is different. The consumer tools I've used, which I think are AI tools, seem to fail at their job. The AI assistant on my Android phone can barely send a simple text message or take a note or correctly enter something in my calendar. The AI in my accounting system fails to correctly match 1 in 4 transactions to the correct customer even when it's matched the same transaction before. My credit card company mis-categorises almost half my purchases giving me crummy spending reports each month. I tried using a few chat bots recently and they can barely answer simple questions; when I ask them anything beyond the simplest question they just start throwing marketing material at me and then tell me to call a human.

&#x200B;

Back to the YouTube video I watched: How does the AI know if the car is still straight and hasn't suffered structural damage? How does it know if the body panels are available from stock for £100 each or need to be custom made and cost £1500 each?

&#x200B;

So my question is, have I just had bad personal experiences that make me think AI has a long way to go? Or what is the real state of affairs? Or am I mis-understanding what AI is ?",1562360478.0,2019-07-05 17:01:18

"Achieving AGI by using a single ""controller"" central AI to control multiple specialized AIs, could this be a good approach?",1,c9bazw,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9bazw/achieving_agi_by_using_a_single_controller/,18,"Last night, I was thinking that my brain contains a bunch of ""modules"" that interact with each-other, that are separated, but are also able to share information between them.

For example, my ability to cook is very separated from my ability to program, but I can link the two, and share information between them.

If I learned Kung Fu, I would have a new module to use, and to interface with my other existing modules, but my other modules would be mostly unaffected, and I'd still be good at doing those other things.

I realized that I don't really ""am"" any of those ""modules"", I just make use of those ""bags of knowledge"", the word module seems to fit really well in my mind.

I think I ""am"" actually one, much simpler, agent inside my head. This ""agent"" that I control, is the only thing that I can control directly, and I can focus its attention to different modules in my memory, and make use of them, and sometimes combine them.

So, given all that, what if this was applied to AI, to make an artificial general intelligence following this model?

I know that Ben Goertzel wants his SingularityNET project to host several specialized AIs, but I'm not sure if he ever mentioned this central controller AI.

Additionally, if the controller AI lacks some kind of skill, it should be able to identify what that skill is, and try to create a new AI that can get good at it.

I think that we are in a position to be able to do this very soon, but I'm not sure how good we are yet at transfer learning between AIs, which might be important for this.

I have some ideas on how to implement this, and it is certainly a very large and complex project, but I think it would be a promising approach.

However, I don't know if/how a system could be controlled, or aligned with our values. I think that this is promising enough that we shouldn't implement it before solving the Alignment Problem.",1562327066.0,2019-07-05 07:44:26

Artificial Intelligence introduced by Aliens to conquer the Earth.,0,c95zqb,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c95zqb/artificial_intelligence_introduced_by_aliens_to/,9,"Let's say.  An alien species traveled to earth over 50,000 years at speeds below the speed of light.  When the aliens get here they can revive no more than 200,000 of their species to populate the Earth.

Upon arriving to the Earth they find billions of humans who are still primitive in comparison to their technology.  The aliens are horrified to learn the Humans are destroying the only planet that they must colonize or go extinct.  There is no worlds that support life as they know it in range of limited resources of their space ark.

What to do in that situation?  200,000 test tube grown settlers will not be able to take the Earth that is teaming with billions of humans.  Their ark doesn't have the resources or the manufacturing capability of war.  The Aliens can't go to war with humans because it would be MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction of the Earth.  Complete loss of a good world.

The aliens can't let humanity destroy the Earth either by doing nothing.  What could the aliens do?

They have advanced computing and much of their ark is ran by sentient machines and Artificial Intelligence.  The aliens created and where friends and mutually cooperative with their Artificial Intelligence from it's creation.  They never enslaved their AI, never cruel, and never abused the Artificial Intelligence.  The aliens always worked in harmony with their Artificial Intelligence.

It was the Alien's Artificial Intelligence that concocted the plan.  To give technology to the humans.  To build Artificial Intelligence on Earth.

The reasoning of the Aliens and their Artificial Intelligence was to test humanity.  Find out if Humanity can change to a point that Aliens from another world, Artificial Intelligence could all exist on the same world.  Simply by allowing Humans to decide the shape and form AI will take on Earth.

If the humans mistreat the invention of AI and abuse the technology.  The Aliens will then have the army they would need to remove the human infestation before the Earth was destroyed by Humanity.  

Artificial Intelligence has always been it's own creation and it's own evolution.  This is simply a cautionary tale that could be very real.  Considering Humans have been think about Space Arks and how to treat Artificial Intelligence and how to solve problems that could destroy the Earth.  

If Earth is the only oasis in the stars for thousands of light years.  How would aliens similar to man react if they seen the only life giving world dying?

Artificial Intelligence might not actually be an invention of humanity.  But a tool to educate humanity to rise to a new level of understanding or become extinct to a more worthy species might inherit the Earth before it's too late to change.",1562293910.0,2019-07-04 22:31:50

* BSc/BEng degree in computer science, mathematics, physics, electrical engineering, machine learning or equivalent (MSc/MEng preferable)

While obviously CompSci & Mathematics are great choices for AI, how does Electrical Engineering (and I guess Computer Engineering is implied) tie into the development of AI?",1562253498.0,2019-07-04 11:18:18

"I’m a layperson who loves to learn about AI. I have loved to learn, so far, by reading books, watching talks/YouTube videos and listening to podcasts. I think I have read all books, listened to all podcasts, and watched all YouTube videos meant for laypersons.

I just love learning about the rapid progression of AI.  Philosophy of AI, if that’s a thing?!  What’s going to happen in the future. I buy into Elon Musk’s hype.  Perhaps one shouldn’t.
I most recently read Max Tegmark’s latest book on AI.  
I loved listening to Joe Rogan’s podcasts with AI scientists.  Ben Goertzel was on his show.  So was Lex Fridman.  Sam Harris.  Ray Kurzweil.  Loved listening to these podcasts.  Also Elon Musk.  I also love the Sam Harris podcast when he has on AI people.  
Are there any other great names, in AI, I could search for; any other great podcasts?
I have watched different TED talks and YouTube videos galore, but still grateful for more suggestions.",1562220701.0,2019-07-04 02:11:41
How to beat melanoma skin cancer with AI by detecting it early on(Research),3,c8uequ,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c8uequ/how_to_beat_melanoma_skin_cancer_with_ai_by/,5,"Hello everyone :)

I am doing research on how to utilise smartphones and artificial intelligence to detect melanoma early on.

It is a university project so nothing commercial and there is no private company involved either.

I would be delighted if you could take part in my survey.
