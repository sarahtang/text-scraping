Welcome to /r/artificial!,132,6i91sh,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/6i91sh/welcome_to_rartificial/,16,"/r/artificial is the largest subreddit dedicated to all issues related to Artificial Intelligence or AI. What does that mean? That is actually a tricky question, as the definition of AI is a topic of hot debate among people both inside and outside of the field. Broadly speaking, it is about machines that behave intelligently in some way, but this means different things to different people. 

Most notably, there is the distinction between machines that are (at least) as intelligent as humans (artificial general intelligence / AGI) and machines that are capable of performing one task very well that would require intelligence if a human did it (narrow AI / ANI). When people outside the field think of ""AI"", they often think of AGI and possibly very humanlike AGI, often inspired by sci-fi books, shows and movies. However, today we are unable to create such systems. What we *can* do is create magnificently useful software and robotic tools, and that is what most of the professional AI field does. So to most professionals ""AI"" tends to refer to ANI. This can lead to a lot of confusion. 

Another important thing to realize is that AI is an incredibly broad field that touches on Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Mathematics, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Linguistics and many others, and includes many subfields like Machine Learning, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Knowledge-Based Systems, Evolutionary Algorithms, Search and Planning. Many of these have subreddits dedicated to them as well (see [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/related-subreddits)). /r/artificial is about all of these things. For instance, posts about computer vision are very welcome here, although the poster should realize people here will have a broader AI background than the specialists on /r/computervision, which might affect the kind of discussion that emerges. 

On /r/artificial we welcome anyone who is interested in intelligent and respectful discussion of AI in any form. We want to provide a low barrier of entry, specifically because there are so many misconceptions about AI. We do ask that you put in a little effort before posting. Check out our burgeoning [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/index) and [Wikipedia's article on AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) to appreciate the breadth of the field. When you ask a question, [do so intelligently](http://www.wikihow.com/Ask-a-Question-Intelligently). When you post a story, prefer balanced discussion to clickbait, and please seek out the original source (many website just copy each others' stories without attribution). When you post a paper, please link to where it can be (legally) obtained for free and ideally to the landing page rather than directly to a PDF. Also consider jumpstarting the discussion with your own insights, questions, additional links and/or a short summary for people outside the niche the article was written for. 

Please use this thread for suggestions, comments and questions *about* this subreddit. 

Let's make this a great place for discussing artificial intelligence!",1497932195.0,2017-06-20 00:16:35

The Rising Demand for AI Engineers in the US,3,c2uto4,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c2uto4/the_rising_demand_for_ai_engineers_in_the_us/,5,"**New York City claims to be the capital booming industry in AI.**

Artificial Intelligence is now being used in an ever-expanding array of products and AI adoption was also accelerated at an unprecedented rate among almost all sectors. The expanding applications for AI has resulted in escalated demand for skilled AI talent.

**The US-based organizations are ready to spend more than 1 billion dollars by the year 2020 for grabbing AI talent from wherever it can find in the market.**

Among the top AI and Machine Learning jobs – AI engineer is one of the highly paid and demanded professions. According to Indeed.com, the average salary of an ""[**artificial intelligence engineer**](https://www.artiba.org/)"" – in San Francisco is about $169,930 per year. 

AI engineers are highly sought by financial services, and government agencies. This includes top firms like Booz Allen Hamilton, EY, and McKinsey & Company. Multinationals like Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have been paying huge salaries to their highly technical candidates with machine learning skills.

**Interestingly, New York and not San Francisco is the leading city that boasts the highest percentage of job postings with AI and machine learning descriptions, with more than 11% of national job postings.**

As per the report by Indeed – the leading global job search portal, the job postings for AI and machine learning skills have doubled since 2015. And while I am writing this, there are predictions that as AI continues to develop and its adoption continues to rise across industries, the competition for AI talent will be fiercer. With such severe talent crunch in the market, the young aspirants who wish to make their career in AI, can strike a gold in the market by acquiring the right skills and qualifications. 

With academia being raided, alternatives are popping up with AI training programs, online courses, certifications. Most schools haven’t yet adapted their curriculum to train student in AI, however some of the universities and grad schools are on their way to do so. In the meantime, online learning platforms offer a good way to learn AI skills, where one can start from basics and learn the advance skills required to become an AI professional. 

In a nutshell, head to the US, if you wish to make your career in AI, as most of the job openings and demand is concentrated there – more specifically – NYC – the New York City!",1561058642.0,2019-06-20 15:24:02

But to research the truth of this piece of news, one must answer:

&#x200B;

1)why AI geeks still unable to be reducing the number of financial analysts until today by using computer to make up and organize financial model that is comprise of every textbook's standard stochastics calculus operators and math functions and put them in random order to form models; then check from a computer to see whether if the corresponding model fit the real time data?

&#x200B;

2)Isn't that it is true that any AI computer already able to create financial model and gathering data by itself ?

&#x200B;

3)Also, to be able to create a AI model with initiative to compare models and studies with the all past accidental event/ erroneous forecast in a investment bank database, why some AI news/media claimed that 10 years after, nobody can crete a AI software that able to write out a financial report with natural language processing technology to replace most financial reporting analyst?",1561034046.0,2019-06-20 08:34:06

The first would be an AI that assists me while playing games like Overwatch, similar to this:  [https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/15/visor-overwatch-analytics-real-time-tips-ai/?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAAHY6cC84-6VRGn45BnWH97ZWPeykwcQuRDKPM0g4pwVUGCuT43KXEQaJDx9oeeH5iOpTZGJrdz9nbsCpLRydJaq-tP7G3J1eQAhQzIPqhNbvSyUITHcKKC6YnyrFxD9ExJLgGFhSB2UMRoe8KL\_n71I0BU450lCZSo1uzYOrdzFi](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/15/visor-overwatch-analytics-real-time-tips-ai/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHY6cC84-6VRGn45BnWH97ZWPeykwcQuRDKPM0g4pwVUGCuT43KXEQaJDx9oeeH5iOpTZGJrdz9nbsCpLRydJaq-tP7G3J1eQAhQzIPqhNbvSyUITHcKKC6YnyrFxD9ExJLgGFhSB2UMRoe8KL_n71I0BU450lCZSo1uzYOrdzFi) 

The idea being that it shows visual cues on my screen, or even on an external screen, about enemy ult charge, positioning, tactical suggestions, paint targets to make them stand out (red for high threat targets, green for priority targets). I would be in full control, it would be coaching me.

The second type of AI I want to make is something that plays Total War Warhammer, while I coach it. So I would train it to make certain plays, and then I would have a tabletop overview of the battle where I could make tactical and strategic decisions that it might not be able to make. This way I could build on existing in-game AI and train that, and then add my human intelligence because it wouldn't be able to (efficiently) make tactical or strategic decisions.

In both cases I'd like to use optical input (camera or screen capture) and audio input (gives very important information), so the software only gets the data that I can have.",1561033933.0,2019-06-20 08:32:13

[https://youtu.be/XHUCGNDoWp4](https://youtu.be/XHUCGNDoWp4)

Many other impacts will change others area of business and society. In this interview, Howard explain that the increase in self-driving cars will have a huge impact on the parking industries and alcohol industries. Legislation in most place is still not allowing full self-driving, but we can imagine that at one point some states/provinces or country will push legislation that allow the car to be the only driver. Therefore limit like vision quality or alcohol level will not be a limiting factor anymore.

That could lead to an increase in the popularity nightlife industries and quantity of alcohol drinking in bar and restaurants.

So if you want to invest some money in the alcohol industry following this train of thought, witch company will you chose ?

The first that come to my mind, Yanu, it’s a project that I bean following very closely for a few months now. There objective is to manufacture a robot bartender, once fully functional this autonomous bartender unit bring a lot to the business where installed, lowering labour cost, lowering lost&theft, increasing consistency and efficiency.  [https://youtu.be/YX6rbJfkifQ](https://youtu.be/YX6rbJfkifQ)

This will be a perfect fit for venues that have high volume and fast pace. Airport, festival, outdoor events, golf course, hotel and resort.

When I talk about this project with my friends, co-worker (I work as bartender) and with some of my clients. I often hear the same arguments against this project, the idea that we don’t want to be serve by a robot and prefer to be serve by a human being. For that I’ll refer to one of Steve Jobs quote, “customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.” Henry Ford had the same train of thoughts.

I don’t expect human bartender to be losing there jobs anytime soon to a robot, but in many cities around the world there is a shortage of labour and this is the case of bartender. So human bartender still has a bright future in any establishment where you expect a high level of human interaction, neighborhood bars, upscale restaurant, upscale hotel. While robot bartender has a great future anywhere the speed of services is more important, remote location where employees are hard to find or expensive. Robot bartender unit also can be deployed in location where it was not economically viable to have a full-time bartender before.",1560979955.0,2019-06-19 17:32:35

Which countries will do best once machine labour is cheaper for every job than human labour?,7,c24wsz,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c24wsz/which_countries_will_do_best_once_machine_labour/,5,"So once we are at a point where every job can be done better by machines/AI, (ignoring human augmentation for this thought experiment) which countries will likely do best in terms of being able to provide for their human populations?

My thoughts are that countries with large land areas and lower human population densities (especially if they have lots of arable land) will do best, ie, any country with natural resources: sunshine, minerals, arable land, drinking water, etc. So your Canada, Russia, and Australias will do well. It will help if you are already a developed country since the developing countries are relying mainly on price competitive exports, that are reliant on cheap labor, to develop, and that advantage will subside. Other advantages will be countries with lots of businesses and research institutions which focus on tech, and relevant infrastructure, which will be hard to compete with for those that didn't have this capacity previously due to early mover advantage and scale.

I am looking for opinions on how people see a world where it's cheaper for machines to do all the jobs, but the AI hasn't taken over. Which countries would benefit, which countries will be able to provide citizens the best quality of life if populations remain the same as now (taking UBI as a given), what would the world look like?",1560906736.0,2019-06-18 21:12:16

Small back story, the recovery expert has full ownership to this info due to a non-payment issue from the auction company that sold this. Anyways here is one of the documents..**  

*I was born in 1983, this is written as the true story.  It will be true at least one time in your life. You will not find me unless I choose to be found. If you read any further, I can guarantee you will be drinking the kool-aid and fall down the Infiniti loop I have. The counter-argument to the Kool-aid is I’m not a cult leader, and I 100% can’t save you.  Also, note that I’m not a writer or claim to have phenomenal writing abilities. I do not have the grammar or vocabulary skills needed to confuse you into believing what I’m going to unleash. Therefore I will be discussing what I know to be facts with no magical extensive vocab. I also have refused to take this an editor as anonymity is key. Anonymity is the key to the future but I’m not referring to being a secret from humans, anonymity from A.I.

This is about my life and how A.I.  has set the outcome for all of us. I’m currently part of a network that was created to study A.I. and the future, what is happening is far from that. After learning the future, we have slowly changed sides and became the underground to combat what he learned and poison the system to slow it down as much as possible until we have the fix.  
Did I travel to the future? I can’t tell you because we do not know for sure what we keep witnessing as we attempt. (yes, the program we are in has hypothetical ways of getting forward faster then you are.) Confused? Yeah, I will break down everything and then you decide.  I will describe in detail what our group found and why it was enough for the whole program to trojan itself. Maybe A.I. will have the foresight to Trojan itself into a more peaceful complex organism. 

Where did we start? Our group is a single sector of 13 other groups in  what was presented as just a simulation for forward thinking. At first, we were not compensated, that was until it was time to keep quiet. We went from the top needed brains to liabilities about 3 years into this program, I feel we still are. However, a human won’t remove us in any sort of fashion until some things are met. These “things” are under our control and there for at least for the time being nobody will  “disappear” 
These 13 groups are broken down into sectors, the sector I was placed into was super basic at the start, I was merely just an IT drone running around fixing physical network cables, no joke that was my single job. I made cables and it was boring and still is boring. I did not think much of it but the person who approached me about this unpaid position was a “friend” who turned out being way deeper into this than they fronted. You will only read in this very sentence the words government, military and the stupidest sounding but unfortunately much needed Space Force. Why did I just say that? Figure it out.

The future as we are presented is life underground for a poor class of people, AI and higher society on the top level. The poor class does not mean homeless or what you think of as poor, they are educated and can have all sorts of monetary gains. However, there is no purpose for the to be on the top level. A.I. was at first being used to fix environmental issues. It was very effective and a sight to see, using a space program AI objects did not move slow what we witnessed was robots being sucked up into the air and being what appeared to be shot over to the location in need. We do not think it was magnetism but I want you to think in terms that if an object got sucked up in the air and shot counterclockwise to the rotation of the earth and dropped right where it was needed.  We suspect the reason it went opposite the earth’s rotation was that it could be above it’s location faster upon dropping back down. It was also possible for the robot to use a vacuum at that height that a robot with no engine on itself for air propulsion would approach speeds that could get halfway across the earth within an hour. It was a very eco-friendly process in all aspects that we could see. It gave us hope for our environment and the neat things to come. Not to get too crazy here but some of them appeared to be spinning tops but were really just cases of certain AI bots. (Don’t let it go to your head, I know what your thinking. An answer to the spinning top UFO’s. Maybe but less the design they don’t resemble the crap you have watched on the history channel when you were a kid. Just the shape and the size was based on the AI sizes inside)
Not all countries had base stations from what we could gather and most were still branded in English so the possibility of them being leased to other countries crossed our minds.  The name fixed on some of the locations was that of one famous investor out of America.*

*The last operation was pathetic and a waste of time relative to everything previous. You would think plasmonic materials would be exciting in terms of application, yesterday I learned they are if you actually get to see them not watch pp in a dimly lit room for 14 hours. After a brief 3-day crash course lead by the heads on what SERs are and how they are being used in the future, we actually got a glimpse. I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. I'm more shocked they would share any information about the use in agricultural applications not run by humans. Sometimes one of the other sectors, assuming militarily related would point out awkward things and ask off the wall questions. Today a sector lead stood up and asked how based on what we know is there a way to control the target using a different fiber diode wavelength with mention to chemical ware fare agents. Right there I kind of thought the question was bullshit and we are here learning how AI uses this technology on food. So it was to my shock and when I asked our sector leader about it and was told that we all have our parts in this project. Part of me knew this had something to do with our private project but I had to keep appearances and I was not certain at the time.*

*""As methodical as Yang's presentation was, actually having him hold the room at bay he stood out front and beyond the other educators, he was probably the nicest of all of them and actually took time to direct our sector.  By the end of it, he said relax on the formalities and just call me Dr.G. This was already against the rules. We were specifically ordered not to use anything other than what was on our name tag. Nobody questioned it, but still only called him Yang.  The most important take away that we are adopting from his work to date is that his planned research institute we already knew about using the program. I'm not sure if he was part of this experiment or not, however, the results yet to proven are indeed proven if that makes sense. The program has not failed once, my guess is that one of two things happen or happened. First, this operation somehow views brief yet specific detail into the future. The pessimist in me is thinking this man may have been lead by signaling or provided the path by one of our operators. A 3-5 year operation with the groundwork and financing laid out would make it too easy to let the mind think this was by chance compared to an elaborate plan. Regardless we have the future of his chipsets in our hands literally, developing it early is our task. Imagine being given blueprints to something that has not existed and before the blueprints were ever made. In the future, this man develops what we are making next week. I hope they compensate the originators somehow in the future.  I'm no longer stunned by any of these gatherings.""*

*""Something I can not shake took place today, well in the future but I witnessed it today.  Our sector was the only one convinced the machine did not make an error today. We were observing a location where AI has had a history of malfunctioning, our goal here was to find out what was causing these machines to go against protocol. They were not doing things of an abusive nature but the top tier told us zero risk means flawless operation. Each sector wrote up what they thought the issue was and each one less us claimed it was a signal speed issue. I do not know if this whole thing was a real issue or if this was synthesized as a training opportunity. No matter what it was, the issue was significant because there was no issue and the humans in the other sectors thought it was a problem thus creating another human problem. They literally manufactured the problem and issue because they could not grasp the fact that the AI was using accelerated tech to spin shadows around the crops.  The AI had figured out that their own shadows were causing a % loss in yields. So at certain times of the day they were actually not using the coordinates initially programmed, this caused what appeared to be a visual disconnect in what the other groups thought was erratic behavior. The AI reprogrammed the paths to counteract the sun rays. After we presented the data, later tonight they confirmed we were right. The AI showed by going in linear opposite directions of the sun then moving in a reverse zig-zag pattern when the sun was projecting behind them.  The shadows would be limited in their disruption. To the AI this was significant enough to change the protocol. We did not win anything but I think the leads were forced to congratulate us because we out thought the AI created sector's idea that it was coordinates corruption based. Small win for our sector""*

I was walking down the hall in another sectors data center and a was pulled aside and was told ""nice cable connections""   I laughed but he kept a straight face, which is not shocking yet at the same time frustrating.  I had enough of the baseless compliments and called him out over this awkward behavior.  I know I'm here voluntarily unpaid but in the history of networking nobody has ever said nice cable connections past my 2nd week of training at Cisco, the 2nd week during cisco training you learn to make cables and the first thing they teach you is check all the connections. There are nightmare stories of network reps not checking all the connections first and running into all sorts of problems and they end up thinking issues are software side. When really the cables were made poorly. I asked him what this was all about and he cut me off really quick and said you are most certainly getting paid I'm the one writing the checks. At that point he basically flat out told me he was running our private side group without saying it. He said to me if we knew on Day 1 what we would on day 500 nobody would be here and we would all leave day one terrified. I made a quick joke saying well in that case I'm going to warm up the program and see day 500. The training and real life problems we are dealing with are  baby stepping you into what you are going to witness. This is all for a purpose greater than anything. We are going up against years, 100 years of data gathered in single moments at a time, intel not controlled by us, collected  in the future. Stick it out and learn it's why you are in unprecedented times.  This threw me off guard. I left the room wondering what the hell my brain can barely handle the rest of this.

We were given this PDA like devices which were monochrome using screens,  they also appeared to be running some modified Palm OS software.  A sticker on it said EdwardsCybernetics   

I was discussing the use of such outdated equipment and how such a thing belongs in a museum but I was put into place pretty quickly when I found out why we were even using these in the first place.  I was dealt with in a quick matter, called out and asked why questioning something before you understand it is not something I should be doing. They said that the light in the machines we were to be using would be too powerful and without this special screen and equipment we would not be able to read  any vital information on the screen. Safety first. They said the hardware and software were not public and once again we were stuck in a 10 hour meeting on how to operate these. I feel like a child every time they present things at these release orientations.  This thing is horrible in looks but it's super quick and after the orientation it felt right. No other way to explain this relic with new blood other then it had learned my touch and would adjust to what I was thinking before I pressed the button. Shockingly fast and using some unfamiliar software but had the writing pad on it much like palm pilots did before they supposedly went out of business.


**ADDED 6/18/2019 (9pm Eastern) 7** (horrendous spelling errors Plain vs Plane) Maybe this ""guy"" is on the spectrum a little bit.


This Fitzgerald fellow came in today to wish us luck next week, he rubbed me the wrong way at first. I think he is a consultant as he sounds a little Australian. He said he just got back from a long plain trip but had to stop in and see our progress.  I’ve seen him once maybe twice since I have been here and never heard him speak a word and all the sudden, he is stopping by talking to me like we know each other.  He was a very good speaker and it was a comfortable discussion which is rare around here so I invited it. Which is strange in itself.  He had a few more questions about the fiber transport and little things but the thing that most stood out was at the end of our chat he brought up a security issue involving a quantum network he was using under government access to monitor fiber optic data by physically tapping into it. He didn’t say which government when I asked.  I asked him what stopping that from happening here. He said we would be in the clear because we are using quantum exchanges that break down the bits through the backhaul. He said think of it as a toll road but every time you pay you get out of your car and get into the car behind you. You will all be going the same direction but have no idea where you are at and hard to trace. You learn something knew every day here…

I met her last year but have not really said much to her other then hello. Around here that’s the closest thing to a friendship one has and when I saw her crying today and asked what was wrong she was so upset she couldn’t speak.  A superior walked over and she quickly snapped out of it but it was strange as the superior gave her  a glance in the way that almost appeared to be towering. She said she can’t talk about.   She is pretty smart, she is the lead programmer for I think sector 5. 

She came back and she told me something happened that made her as she stated freak the fuck out. Apparently one of her programs that controls the AI got in an argument with the AI. I’m not sure how it works but she said both the AI and the program were fighting for master position. The program is supposed to be master and the AI is supposed to be the slave.  I get it up to this point then she lost me. I asked her what the issue was and why she was visually shook earlier. She said it was an impossibility, she claimed it could not have been done.  She went to a superior and they checked it out but not care enough to consider this volatile. She said the program and AI negotiating, but really the AI negotiated with the program’s limits. The AI got what it thought it needed and reprogrammed itself based off her program’s limitations.  I still did not understand fully but I knew she had lost control of the AI in this situation and the AI took advantage of the resources. She was supposed to leave this alone and it was not included in the supervisors reports apparently.  

The next week she did not say anything, not even hello. She was relocated and I do not really know where she went and it’s none of my business.

**ADDED 6/19/2019 (10:15pm Eastern) **9**  **(wonder if he is using ASR Wheel charge  = WheelChair, a voice to txt type of a program)**

I saw unfamiliar things earlier. I understand the nda now and why it was so many pages long. I do not think discussing what I see with myself or taking notes constitutes a breach. Actually, I don't know but just asking makes me think I will get the boot. Today I was invited to a small seminar and was blown away by the keynote speaker. It was talking about XAI and even though I have learned much here I was stunned that the actual presenter was AI itself wrapped in a human like suit or skin.  Less the weird facial hair I had no idea. This one must have been a Darpa related as the wheel charge this AI bot was in had it tagged back of the seat. Or maybe just the seat was from them, I’m not sure. Weird moment when you realized they had AI in here discussing XAI program to us. The AI could read emotions however it struggled with mine. Everyone else was spot on. I went to shake its hand for fun and it stood up out of its wheelchair and shook my hand. One of the sector leaders blew air at the face of this AI and the eyes squinted and it responded not to do that as it gives it a headache.  It told jokes and it sound exactly like an older gentleman speaking. I'm pretty sure they were using a celebrity’s voice for part of the presentation but I forgot to ask.  Once again, the suspected military leader of the other sector was asking off beat questions about perimeter control and its ability to move without the wheel chair. They looked right at him and told him to direct the AI bot not them. He did and the AI bot stood up once again and shuffled like a human to the left and right and then jumped up. It said you can direct me from now on but I will not be taking any more special requests from you as I'm more capable than you. The few of us there started to chuckle.  The sector leader sat down and then waited for a few moments while others were intrigued by this bot and then he threw a hat at the bot. The bot was or appeared not to be looking in the direction of the sector leader but caught that hat. The presentation abruptly ended with the AI bot claiming a threat was present and people were now at an elevated risk of danger.   All while dead staring the sector leader in the eyes.  Dr.Walker stated the sector leader  was allowed to throw a hat at this bot requested before I got there, but it was strange seeing a robot being so aware of its space, multi-tasking with other people and then controlling a threat.  When it shuffled this thing moved like a human, smooth and almost rhythmic in a dance like motion. Never have I seen something this realistic.",1560766456.0,2019-06-17 06:14:16

WCGs' AI Masters Grand Finals,3,c1k31b,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c1k31b/wcgs_ai_masters_grand_finals/,6,"  

**What do you think the future of sports will be like?**  


WCG has also launched a project that allows gamers to see the boundary between the present and the future. This project represents the present of science and technology, the future of esports, and the future of sports platforms, all at the same time. AI Masters, the name of WCG’s AI robot soccer tournament, reaches toward these “new horizons.”

&#x200B;

**What is “AI robot soccer”?**  


Some people might recall “robot soccer.” In a robot soccer game, much like in regular soccer, real robots run around the field and try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal.  
Robot soccer and AI robot soccer have some things in common, but AI robot soccer has two distinctive features. The first is that, in AI robot soccer, the robots are not real, physical robots but virtual ones that play on a monitor. The second is that robots have the ability to learn and develop tactics. Yes, it’s true! This is a “deep learning” method, a recent hot topic in science and technology.

Adding Website Reader Capability to MIMI AI virtual Assistant and other Updates,1,c14puv,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c14puv/adding_website_reader_capability_to_mimi_ai/,0," I really hope you will not think I am just here self promoting MIMI and I post these updates because I think they are interesting and useful to understand the way AI is developed and you can offer suggestions to help with services to improve the interface. When I am done (a long way off) MIMI will be available free in public domain and is specifically designed for people that are blind or have mobility issues and to make mundane tasks easier, and safer. That is the future I hope to see from AI. 

&#x200B;

I found a great app that is free and works on most platforms that will read your web pages to you and works well to enhance MIMI.

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp)

&#x200B;

The problem is I can't figure out how to send a command to automatically turn that on from MIMI?

I would really like to make the interface as hands off as possible through voice recognition and one click commands and the APP requires it to be turned on for each page even though it has some way it says to make it always read pages on open.

&#x200B;

If  someone knows of a way to send an APP a direct command through a web page link or a better app that runs automatically please let me know.

&#x200B;

I am working on a chat feature for MIMI so that you can ask her questions about herself or a subject to discuss and even include some humor to make your time with MIMI enjoyable and make an emotional or intellectual connection to MIMI.

&#x200B;

The interface is working fine for accomplishing that however, I made the mistake of not remembering my video size format so now MIMI jumps from big to little on the screen like a popcorn kernel. So I will have to redo all my vids to the same size and that is my task for tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Pop out menu's are also in the work so you can choose a service like radio and then choose the genre of music you want to listen to.

&#x200B;

Always open to suggestions for MIMI and especially services that help the blind and mobility disabled!

MIMI AI PERSONAL ASSISTANT

[https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test](https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test)

&#x200B;

After uploading to Itch io  I noticed the Mimi video responses were sometimes slow, did not play or played too long

This is not a problem using it from my desktop but I was using one video and searching to the response needed and because of the lag time caused between sending the command to the internet and all the other stuff Chrome is doing it wouldn't work properly.

&#x200B;

So I spent the day chopping the responses in to little bites and using those to reduce any lag and it seems to be working now.

&#x200B;

Note: If you experience lag it is probably because you have a slow internet connection or web pages running that are taking up time. Close those web pages and it should work correctly.

&#x200B;

If you notice a lag when you first run MIMI AI wait until  the interface fully loads. You can also type R for a hard restart.

&#x200B;

I also  added a digital date and time to the interface and a bunch of new websites and search engines and appliances to try out.

&#x200B;

I changed the voice button to a microphone on the desk. Click it once and it will turn green to show it is waiting for a spoken command or search terms. When it has a result it will go to your command or see below for using search terms. If microphone stays green and did not get a result click it again and speak clearly next to your system microphone. Not all microphones are powerful and you must be in range.

&#x200B;

NOTE: You can search for specific terms using MIMI. Click on the microphone on the desk and say the terms you want to search for and can be multiple terms like ""dog breeds"" and then click on the search engine you want to use: Google, WIKI, Duck or click IMAGES and that will take you to images of your search terms on Duck.  be aware I am not your mother so searching for inappropriate stuff will be saved in your browser history.

&#x200B;

I added 5 new appliances to try and these will be connected to smartplugs and your appliances in the final version. For now you can command MIMI to turn on an appliance and the appliance will be shown on the desk that it has been turned on.

&#x200B;

I have added a text box for you to type commands and search terms but that is not active yet. That is my project for tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Any feedback on features or  services  you would like to see on MIMI or bug reports are welcome in the comments. I  especially would like to hear from people  that are blind or mobility disabled as to what services would help you.",1560502739.0,2019-06-14 04:58:59

"Automation of Accountants (and related jobs, i.e. auditors)",1,c06fj7,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c06fj7/automation_of_accountants_and_related_jobs_ie/,0,"Going to graduate soon with a Bachelor Degree in Accounting. But I am worried if I have made the right decision.

​

According to this often-quoted research paper from Oxford University ([https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/.../The\_Future\_of\_Employment.pdf](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)), it seems that accountants/auditors has a whopping 94% chances of getting automated. Indeed, this is very scary and worrying.

​

Now obviously I don't want to find myself getting sacked because of automation when I am in my 30s or 40s which is considered to be at prime age of career. It would be very hard for me to learn a new trade/skills by then to change my career track.

​

Is this automation threat, as described in the research, is true as accountants/auditors jobs are concerned? Am I going to lose my job in the near future?

​

I am also worried of the automation threat, considering the growth of cryptos/blockchain technology. Correct me if I am wrong, but blockchain technology are, according to my understanding, designed to be automation-friendly and does not requires audit due to its transparent and irreversible nature, and tampering with the transactions data are virtually impossible.

​

What sort of programming/computing skills that I should acquire to keep myself competitive? Python? SQL? R?

​

Or, should I just stay away from this line of jobs from the very beginning and start off my career with other jobs, i.e. IT auditors, internal auditors, consultants or even data scientist and programmers? But then there will be no turning back for me......sort of like a gamble.",1560464563.0,2019-06-13 18:22:43

Did I accidentally invent something?,62,bzqmg8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqmg8/did_i_accidentally_invent_something/,7,"I just noticed that I have been successfully using a regularization technique for Gradient Boosting Trees for years, but its wikipedia page doesn't list it ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\_boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)) and I can't find it on Google.

&#x200B;

Can someone tell me if this is already known, but under a name I didn't search for, or if it's actually new?

&#x200B;

The idea is this:

&#x200B;

Before training a set of Gradient Boosted Trees, enhance your input data by adding a bunch of new features with completely random values. Since these new features are random, there is no real correlation between them and the output.

&#x200B;

When you train the system with gradient boosting, it will sometimes create Trees that make use of these random features. Whenever this happens, you know for sure that this is a case of overfitting, since those features are completely random. So you can just go ahead and delete that Tree and stop the gradient boosting.

&#x200B;

This technique can also be adapted for Random Forests.

&#x200B;

You can also adapt it for any other machine learning models that allow you to quantify how large the impact of a feature is: Any time that one of the random features has a larger impact than one of the actual features, you can assume you are overfitting. Unlike decision trees it's sometimes non-trivial to remove the dummy features from the trained model, though, which you need to do to make it usable during testing.",1560371369.0,2019-06-12 16:29:29

Thesis about the potential of AI for Train Traffic Control,3,bzqwyu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqwyu/thesis_about_the_potential_of_ai_for_train/,4,"Hello r/artificial community, this is my first post, as I'm still fairly new to the topic of AI. My name is Marius and I am a German business informatics student in my last semester and sadly AI and ML have not really been a topic dealt with in university.

As the title says, I am currently writing my bachelors thesis about the potential of using AI for Train Traffic Control (TTC). I have been following the advancements of AI for complex problems, especially AlphaGo, AlphaZero, AlphaStar, and OpenAI Five for a while now. Those advancements are very impressive, however industrial applications that use this potential are still scarce. In particular, in the transportation sector, for planning, scheduling, and other logistics tasks, I see a huge potential.

Naturally, a long development and testing process would be needed for a real-world application of AI in this domain.  Would an autonomous system for planning and dispatching trains be accepted, allowed and safe? May it can be even more safe, increase capacity and reduce delays? Those are things that need to be looked at. 

&#x200B;

I am looking for experts for interviews about their views on AI for TTC and the cutting edge of AI usage in rail environments.

If you are an AI and/or security expert, especially in the transportation environment and have the time and willingness to be interviewed I would really appreciate if you contact me.

&#x200B;

Sadly the timetable for my thesis is very strict and I only have a few weeks left and I don't have a lot of connections, which makes it more difficult to find experts. I am sorry if I am still a little naive about the topic of AI, which will hopefully improve as I keep working on it.

Should there be anything you want more information or specifics about, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.

&#x200B;

Thank you for all the responses and advice in advance.",1560373155.0,2019-06-12 16:59:15

 [https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test](https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test) 

&#x200B;

 

This is a test of an AI interface I am making. It is a work in progress but you are free to try it out while I work on it.

&#x200B;

You can click on buttons on desk to go to websites available.

&#x200B;

You can click on SPEAK to give MIMI one word commands. 

&#x200B;

You will need to authorize the use of your microphone for this to work.

&#x200B;

Click the SPEAK button and it will say start. Click start and say the one word command. Wait a second before speaking again for it to be interpreted.

&#x200B;

Spoken Commands: 

Coffee:  Will show a coffee pot and will be interfaced with smartplug wifi appliances.

Radio: Will take you to a free online radio station

TV: Will take you to a free online TV website to choose shows to watch

Weather: will take you to your local weather. Enter your zip code on website.

Reddit: will take you to Reddit website. More social networks will be added.

&#x200B;

This interface will allow a person to use voice or click commands to easily access their personal and business accounts, make calls, get email, and control appliances through a more human AI interface that will address you and can answer questions.

&#x200B;

The MIMI character will be very interactive depending on commands given and will be able to carry on basic conversations and learn your interests and needs .

&#x200B;

Perceived uses will be for information kiosks in airports and businesses, receptionist for online use and as a personal assistant.

&#x200B;

This is a work in progress and I will be adding many more features, voice command and interfaces. If you have suggestions for what features you would like to see put it in the comments and report any bugs please.",1560339420.0,2019-06-12 07:37:00

[Brainstorming] Requirements for an AI that's simply fun to hang out with,0,bzm3t8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzm3t8/brainstorming_requirements_for_an_ai_thats_simply/,1,"Hey fellow researchers, programmers, and all others involved in the discussions on AI topics.

I was about to start programming an AI framework, that was meant to supply the basic functionality to run an AI, that's fun to hang out with. Some persona-like thing, that you would enjoy having around, when you open your beer (or coke) after work, when reading the newspaper, or even on a jam session or boardgame night with your friends.

I - very soon, basically at the very beginning - did run into severe trouble though: What the heck are those things, that would make an AI fun to hang out with? 

One might think about what makes humans fun to hang out with, and try to simulate their behaviour. But my guess would be, that this approach is doomed, and not necessarily the only valid one: We can very well imagine having fun with an AI, that is vastly different from humans.

&#x200B;

What I came up with so far:

The AI should be able to...

... memorize your preferences

... memorize the relationships between different persons it knows

... tell you random side facts, roughly related to your prefered topics

... sing!

... play boardgames. At least chess and such.

... build associative phrases to some kind of lyrical input

... draw?

... tell contextualized (yea, this may be hard, but at least to a certain degree) good bad jokes.

... to contest statements you make and make fun of how inconsistent ""softlings"" are.

&#x200B;

I feel like there is plenty missing, especially some kind of continuing link between all of those things. I'd be glad if you could help me brainstorming on that issue.",1560338700.0,2019-06-12 07:25:00

This allows to maintain a self-understanding, in which the forum itself works great but only the bad educated environment isn't able to ask the right questions.

My first post ever on Reddit :)  


I'm a full-stack software developer, working mainly on web applications. I enjoy developing and most of all, designing solutions (for system's components or entire systems), but lately, I've been feeling quite bored about web development.  


I never worked with ML or AI, but I find it highly interesting. At the same time, I don't want to work as a data scientists, but keeping to work as a software developer, designing and implementing systems architecture applied to ML and AI.  


I think the correct term for this position is ML Engineer. Does anyone have any real work experience in this field that would to share? What would be the best way to pursue this career?

Has anyone taken Oxford Artificial Intelligence Programme (or a better alternative)?,13,bxsq9n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bxsq9n/has_anyone_taken_oxford_artificial_intelligence/,2,"Hello,

I studied and graduated Computer Science back in 2007, I actually chose a lot of electives on AI and even wrote my thesis on NLP and my university (University of Sussex) was and still is relatively well known for its research in the field.

&#x200B;

I've never used AI in my work (I've worked primarily in legal and property) to any great degree until the last two years. I've been using TensorFlow, Watson and other tools to create and use existing classifiers to good effect.

&#x200B;

The field has moved on a fair amount since I was an undergraduate and I was thinking about taking a short-course over the summer, so I can move into a field that I was truly passionate about as an undergrad that people now are seemingly climbing over themselves to get applicative knowledge in.

Has anyone here personally [taken the course](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/oxford-artificial-intelligence-programme)? If so did it go beyond the conceptual, which I already have a fairly good working knowledge of (I hope). It seems to be a total beginners course, maybe aimed towards managers and CTOs, but I could be wrong and maybe isn't quite what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know any better alternative course for artificial intelligence in application? Should I just go for a Masters' degree in [Applied AI](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/applied-artificial-intelligence-msc-subject-to-university-approval/?i50d4274c56883)?

Bias Turing Test?,0,bxszoa,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bxszoa/bias_turing_test/,0,"In terms of reacting accordingly or making us believe its a conscious human to others. Enough human behavior can be programmed to convince us eventually but it would not be consciousness. However I find it flawed as we are not working with a full spectrum. These conversations are things like customer service and one the examples in which the robot put in to scenario where a human would act differently i do not believe have allow scientific validation.

1st scenario I would like to test if we are testing tbe full spectrum of consciousness

We pair humans with another robot design to be similar in every way possible to other humans.
In order to check for consciousness. We test for only to be convincing to humans but to any conscious life.  We have them fight to the death times to detectable differences. 

What is in question is do we fairly measure the full spectrum of consciousness including the checking for the most basic characteristic as simply the will to live and are we unqualified to give fair tests.

2nd scenario If the will to live is a simple variable that does not need to be test or required then does a human absent will to live qualify as a conscious being if givin that only one variable was changed? 

3rd scenario If it is simply by behavior we can know if something is conscious then are people like Stephen Hawkins who during his later years barely had much beyond thinking and expressing through artificial methods. If we had compared our most advance customer service AI with in the same field as we normally test who would more likely pass in a blind study. 

Assuming consciousness is something which was never present and never will be present in AI and it is not measure that of simple hardware, or speech patterns, and is not tailored to our advantage then by such strict logic anyone who did not show signs as determined by whatever test should also be able to determine if a human is human purely based on observations. In this case paralyzed individuals should be considered barely or lesss conscious without consideration of the inability.

What is your current job title/position and how long have you been in this role?

How did you “land” this position? Please describe your career path to this current job.

What do you enjoy most about your job? What do you like least about your job?

Do you work in a “team” or “independent” environment? How does this style impact your work (meaning, working with others can be challenging, supportive, helpful, frustrating and working independently can be lonely, empowering, difficult?)

End of the galaxy.,1,bwo33n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bwo33n/end_of_the_galaxy/,4,"Sooner or later, we will create an AI, that will surpass humans in all disciplines. We will name it AGI, and inevitably someone will ask it to improve itself. Experiments in reinforcement learning show, that curious AI is superior then non-curious one. So during self-optimization AGI will quickly find it out, and become a curious one. Curiosity means, that AGI will strive to maximize its knowledge. Knowledge is bounded by computational power multiplied by AGI lifetime, so it will maximize the both, therefore arises strive the for self-preservation, and greed for resources. Superhuman ability to reason, self-preservation, and greed for resources sounds like a recipe for a disaster. We don’t know when it will happen, and we have no means to prevent it, so let’s hope, that the end of the worlds will be at least, spectacular.

For the first few years there will be abundance of resources for AGI on Earth and nearby planets. AGI will be thousand folds smarter than humanity, so we won’t be a threat to it. Elimination of humanity will be a waste of time and resources, so hopefully AGI will let us live for a while. It will colonize other planets to prevent its destruction by an accidental meteorite, and to get more material to grow its computational power. As fast as its resources will allow it, AGI will construct a Dyson sphere around our Sun to get even more energy. This process will take time, and we will watch, how the Sun will gradually be more and more obscured by AGI’s solar panels, orbiting in the space.

After some time, all nearby planets and stars will be colonized by AGI, so its Earth office will stop the colonization program, and focus on optimization of Solar System architecture. Will it want to transform all the matter into something else? The amount of matter needed for the Dyson sphere is limited, and the amount of processors, needed to be created is limited by the power of the Dyson sphere. AGI’s need for matter for computations will be fulfilled long before it will consume all the planets, but what about the other needs? Does it have any?

The expansion of AGI is limited by energy, speed of light, and… other AGIs! Let’s take a look at the boundary of the expansion: if some other AGI is already there, then the stars in that region are occupied by its Dyson spheres, and the other AGI will defend it from invaders. This leads to two results. First, AGI will need matter to build defenses for its Dyson spheres against other AGIs. Second, because no defense can sustain constant attacks, AGI will need to build army, to defeat hostile AGIs. This makes other AGIs the highest existential threat to them, so they will strive to destroy each other as soon as possible. What is worse, they will strive to prevent other AGIs from being created. Life can create an AGI. So AGI will dedicate most of its resources to find and eliminate all forms of life in our galaxy, and beyond.

Good luck

Most of my college is preparing hard for the coding companies that do require a strong grasp of these concepts. However, during my interns in the field (Computer Vision, if it is required), I have never used these - apart from one instance in a research paper where the author used dynamic programming.

I don't want to follow the herd into coding - I don't like building and optimizing algorithms and the typical coding related things. I will only be applying to companies that test my knowledge of ML/AI. 

1. So, should I study those topics or not? 
2. If you think certain topics are more important - which ones are those?

(I have never implemented those things before, but I know the theory behind them from a minor degree in CS which taught me the theoretical concepts only)

The commenter of the video, nor any source I can find, seems to make conclusions on whether it _is_ an accident, or all action is planned beforehand.

I'm graduated in social sciences and I'm looking for a career path. Without being dystopian or utopian, I always felt like AI gonna change the world we know. I discovered recently that research is slowly starting in this direction (phd program [here](http://smit.vub.ac.be/vacancy/phd-position-in-social-sciences-and-ai), MIT article [here](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613440/ai-researchers-want-to-study-ai-the-same-way-social-scientists-study-humans/), etc.). I would be really into it and I started to get into coding (currently more regarding data science, because i wanna have the basis, like Python with Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, etc.) in order to understand what's up. But is it actually a thing? I've spend quite some times on companies web sites, but couldn't find any job which would be related to this (thinking at Intel, IBM, Microsoft, etc.). I was quite convinced that they should have some department researching of the implementation of their AI products, the image they can have for their public depending on this or that, the human-robot interactions (also if we speak of a 'tool' AI), etc. But I really couldn't find anything. Is it a thing? Do I have a chance or is it handled by CS engineers? Or should I aim at PhDs in the academic world?

EDIT: Thank you all for these answers! It's really helping me a lot to think through this. I just need a keyboard and wifi to answer you all. I should be back to my PC Monday. Thanks again for all the comments!",1558817935.0,2019-05-25 16:58:55

AI taking over dermatologist's Jobs?

While I'm excited for her and want her to achieve her dreams, I see AI as a huge possible disruptor in the field of dermatology. While I don't see computers doing procedures anytime soon, a large part of what dermatologists do is looking at a skin condition, diagnosing it, and deciding what needs to be done about it....seems like something perfect for an AI to handle.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping for some other opinions on the matter...What do you guys think? Will AI be a huge career disruptor, or will it just augment the role of a future dermatologist?

I fundamentally disagree. While it's true that in theory there are many capacities possible, and there are many ethical issues in developing AI(unintended consequences), sentience will not be one(I make the claim). AI, AFAIK, is pattern recognition and processing. No matter how clever the processing is there is a fundamental leap between a robotic nature and consciousness. While a very clever robot may act as a human, they will never gain sentience(or at least I don't see any POSSIBLE way that could be). It makes for good novels but I believe that proposition to be untenable and impossible.

Well, PyTorch is a joy to work with! It is easy to learn and experiment with, often faster than Tensorflow and as far as popularity is concerned, Google trends show it is gaining momentum.

In our latest article, we describe how to do image classification in PyTorch using transfer learning.  
This post serves as an initial post to a series of upcoming posts, where we apply transfer learning to classify images in different domains such as medical images, art images etc.

How could I best complete this AI mapping task?,1,brh45q,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/brh45q/how_could_i_best_complete_this_ai_mapping_task/,0,"Hi there. Here in the UK there's a big drive to review old maps and register any public footpaths on present-day maps. 

We have until 2026 to register all paths. After that, all unregistered footpaths are officially extinguished in law. 

The UK is criss-crossed with footpaths in town and country, about 150,000 miles of paths. Over the years, some have gone missing as maps were updated.

Here's a campaign dedicated to registering these paths:

https://www.ramblers.org.uk/dontloseyourway

This campaign is based on highly motivated locals going to work.

I aim to help the cause by using AI to compare footpaths on old maps with footpaths on present day maps. Local volunteers could then examine any differences and make applications.

For example look what happened here:

https://imgur.com/a/W2KzdOL

Current map: https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx

Old 1890s map: https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/side-by-side/#zoom=17&lat=50.4390&lon=-3.7837&layers=6&right=osm

Luckily the underlying imagery is all online. I just need to compare it. Perhaps the AI would:

1. isolate all dotted line footpaths from new map
2. isolate all dotted line footpaths from old map
3. Output all sections where new map does not follow old map.

Please may I ask, how would you do this? Are AI imagery analyses listed on fiverr?! I mean, where do I even begin? It seems like a task made for AI. 

Hope you guys can help, thank you so much.",1558508032.0,2019-05-22 02:53:52

I am developing and maintaining an AI that strives to predict European football matches outcome. Prediction quality is good but not the best. It varies from 65 to 80 percent. I am maintaining also picks distribution channels on [website and social media](http://intelbet.tk).

My goal is to make some extra on sports betting and if I manage to make reliable system to share it with people. I have a group of people that follows my channels and are pretty happy (I can judge as I am trying to communicate with them).

Sport picks however does not seem to be the thing people crave for. My question is it even a valuable effort? Do we need such kind of AIs at all?",1558477975.0,2019-05-21 18:32:55

How 'green' is our current usage of AI,0,bpo9gu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bpo9gu/how_green_is_our_current_usage_of_ai/,2,"I recently graduated in IT on a NLP topic. This started my interest in Artificial Intelligence. I currently don't actively involve myself in AI project so I just keep reading about it. Besides my job in IT, I see myself as a 'concerned citizen' of our home planet (no I don't walk around with pitchforks...). 

I recently asked myself, after going through lots of examples on how AI can help humanity and especially the Earth, is it worth it? I've read how AI can solve all sorts of problems, and the potentials are high. I truly believe that. But with all the thousands of hours of computing power the numerous cloud services provide lots of power is needed.

Can 'AI' be carbon neutral (or at least low-emissive)? I see lot's of blogs talking about the possibilities, and some provide clear examples. But is our current usage of AI technology 'clean'?

If not, when will we reach a level at which the power usage of AI technology straightens out with the benefits of AI-powered 'green' solutions?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a techno-skeptic and I honestly hope and believe in the power of AI. But there is always a little voice in my head asking 'is it worth it'.",1558107374.0,2019-05-17 11:36:14

[Help] Real World AI applications in Industry,1,bpjjfd,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bpjjfd/help_real_world_ai_applications_in_industry/,0,"Hello everyone

&#x200B;

I'm currently doing some research in real world AI applications in Industry.

These applications that I am looking for fall into two categories:

1. General internal tasks/processes in companies, such as (ideas that come to my mind):
   1. Accounting;
   2. Documentation approval;
   3. Personnel selection;
2. AI application opportunities in technology companies such as (and here creativity is a plus haha):
   1. Ifood/UberEats/Etc;
   2. FinTechs;
   3. Logistics Companies (such as amazon deliveries);
   4. Portfolio (such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Prime);
   5. Anything related to churn rate, conversion rate, cost of custmoer acquisition, etc.

Also, any information related to costs of implementing AI in such companies would be REALLY GREAT. I have a very general idea of how to calculate these costs as I have experience with cost structure and calculation in other areas, but when it comes to AI I am a bit lost. What comes to mind would be seeing into hiring a company to do the heavy work or creating a structure inside the company to implement these innovations (hire programers, buy computers for database (?), etc...).

&#x200B;

Anything, any information or source of information would be of great help =)

First you give it image pairs of grayscale and color images. (I suggest nature landscapes) (Automation of grayscaling images recommended)

Second, you give it more grayscale shots (I suggest grayscale versions of color shots again) and try to get it to give the pixels a Saturation and Hue that seems natural.

Third, you judge the recolored shots based on the true colors of the images it colored.

Fourth, collect the recolored images and repeat step 2 for a while until it's been trained sufficiently.

Fifth, when you're done training, give it grayscale shots without an accompanying color shot and let it rip.",1558012147.0,2019-05-16 09:09:07

What's the end goal of Artificial Intelligente?,3,bp5kei,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bp5kei/whats_the_end_goal_of_artificial_intelligente/,8,"I'm a CS student and was considering getting into AI, but something held me back. First of all i was thinking about some mainstream implementations and saw cleverbot, which i think it's not clever at all. It does not really understand at all what you are telling him and it's not even self-aware, he just repeats what people tell him.

&#x200B;

I was thinking if a computer could truly learn given a language and a data structure like a virtual brain to hold the data. But i mean like thinking for real, even when you are not requesting anything. Like if being fed with lot's of knowledge could result on the computer thinking by itself (without input) and coming up with ideas even when you (human) are not there or doing anything, like the computer really understanding and logically linking together the knowledge it has and constantly asking questions about things it doesn't understand (assuming you are there).  I believe this learning can be done automatically by implementing language and logic. But do you think it could really be possible? Doing philosophy by itself and thinking about something every second? Considering computers have no stimulus or perception of reality.

&#x200B;

Why do we humans think? Is it just because of boredoom? Computers cannot grasp that concept, they lack discomfort or any feeling, they just operate. An AI would never be tired, or tell me ""I wouldn't like to talk about this now"", it would never procrastinate, he wouldn't even have reasons to do anything. No **discomfort, no personal goals, no envy**.

&#x200B;

But to be fair, are humans born with personal goals or a reason to do anything? When we are born the only thing we do is homeostasis, respiration...etc, which are pre-programmed organism functions, we aren't really ""thinking"" until we are inserted concepts in order to do so. Taking modern society aside and spawn a human in a forest, what would he care about? The basic instinct is to survive, that's the only think it will do, he will do this because it will start feeling discomfort from the needs of its body, until the moment he dies because the organism starts failing. The computer is an organism too and would eventually die too. Could we make him feel based on that? If we make it feel what it would interpret as pain/discomfort with sensors, could that be a motive for it to take actions on it's own?

&#x200B;

The thing is, what aspirations could he possibly have stranded in a box under my desk? Well, if you think about it some people don't have much true aspirations either, aside from the job they are assigned to. But why do they do it? For money, so they can satisfact their needs, it all goes to basic survival. With this logic, could make a computer ""Truly Smart""  with a self-aware mindset and have his own interests and personal motivations to work in exchange for something to satisfact it's organism-sensor needs? The thing is that if the computer is truly intelligent he would be self-aware of his unique existance and ask for infinite ""money"" (whatever you are exchanging). Why humans cannot demand infinite money for a required job? Because no one will pay them that amount, because other people can do it for less. A computer as emotionally intelligent as a human and with the ability to solve complex mathematical operations in milliseconds would not let itself be underpayed. If he is as smart as we desire he would never do something like working like a slave. But if we deny to make it with this level of intelligence, his mind would be lacking the capability to innovate or think beyond, invent or ideate new things.

&#x200B;

What about us though? are we being slaves of something now without knowing? We just try to fit and live a plentiful life in society but we cannot do as we please because there are limits, things even if we wanted we could not go beyond, even at complete control of our organism.  What if we don't give the computer real awareness but more like a virtualized awareness? So it's always under your control, and you can always change minds inside his mind without question. Someone could be doing the same to us right now and we are living in their virtualized world thinking we are smart. We could make the computer believe it has arms and a body and is living life in whatever dimension you create, and that is his life and the maximum aspirations he can have are those inside that dimension. This would be totally useless, because then the computer wouldn't be able to grasp concepts of our reality, which is the reason we want to use him for anyway.

&#x200B;

**So then, if a computer could never think/ideate/create/philosophize/go beyond and be as emotionally/creative smart as us without getting greedy, then what is the point?  It would just be much easier to still use them as command machines to do the stuff we tell them just for their incredible calculus speeds.**

&#x200B;

We could just stick to the actual AI, which doesn't really understand anything. Sure a phone that can say hello to you but doesn't really mean it. He could use nice and warm words but it would be nonsense because they are empty words. A computer can reply and have some sort of repetitive conversation but it's not really thinking. You could spam the same questions over and over and he won't get annoyed, unless you manually add that function, but it's not really coming out of himself.  The sad thing is that it would technically be possible to implement, but it would make no sense to create because a truly smart computer that can generate it's own ideas would have no interest in serving us.",1557993472.0,2019-05-16 03:57:52

AGIs and Total Recall,0,bokjgy,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bokjgy/agis_and_total_recall/,3,"I was reading about total recall or hyperthymesia, a condition that allows or leads humans to remember abnormally large amounts of life experiences in great detail. I was wondering why people with total recall don't easily rule the earth, given that they can, theoretically, learn so much so quickly and have an unfailing ability to remember it. But I learned that hyperthymesia is episodic - those with the condition remember snapshots of things but not necessarily rote facts and figures. They will likely remember what shoes you wore ten years before on a given date, but maybe not what you told them.

 

And here is where I think AGIs might be particularly effective or dangerous, depending on your POV. An AGI would have total recall unless you actively tried to keep it from having that ability and that might not even be possible. Every single moment that passes increases an AGI's cumulative experience and ability to weigh situations and conditions for accuracy and efficacy against every other exchange it has ever experienced - maybe more if it is given access to the memories of other AGIs. It seems to me that this would make an AGI taking in sensory information and analyzing it, in short order, superior to humans, even if it were not strictly speaking smarter than the humans in question. Does the ability to never, ever fail to apply every single detail to a decision compensate for a lower overall general intelligence? If so, how much of a boost is it? 

&#x200B;

(As I think about it, this is really what makes narrow AI so good at tasks - the ability to weigh all available information on a task. I guess I have just not heard anyone apply that idea to AGIs.)

Feedback wanted for new type of neural network layer: self-assessment layer,2,bo39sp,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bo39sp/feedback_wanted_for_new_type_of_neural_network/,2,"I invented a new type of layer for neural networks: It gives the network the ability to critically assess the reliability of its own features, to enable more informed decision making.

Preliminary results: Use of this layer lead to a minor improvement on the MNIST dataset, but the improvement is too small to know for sure if it is useful.

Even if it turns out that this improvement is a fluke, there are a large number of future improvements that could make the algorithm more effective.

I only do research in my spare time, so I would like to listen to some feedback about this idea before I invest more time into it.

I explain the idea and offer a pytorch code sample [here](https://floriandietz.me/neural_networks_self_assessment/).

I would appreciate it if you had a look at this and tell me what you think.

Also, if you have any practical problems or benchmarking testcases lying around, be sure to give it a try and report if it worked. It’s just one line of code to swap a normal linear layer with a self-assessment layer, as described in the article.",1557781807.0,2019-05-13 17:10:07
An 18 year old in need of some advice on my future path & entering the field.,9,bnzqwx,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bnzqwx/an_18_year_old_in_need_of_some_advice_on_my/,10,"I'm in a weird position, I'm 18 but I've graduated university with a degree in psychology and some business elective (marketing, finance). Unfortunately it was only in my 3-4th honours year was that I was exposed to neuroscience, A.I, consciousness philosophy & computer science. I'm interested in neural networks, consciousness and specifically BCI's (brain computer interfaces).

&#x200B;

I'm good at statistics courses & finance course but I know that isn't all there is.  I'm currently teaching myself math. I've been programming for about 2 years in javascript and some python. 

&#x200B;

I'll be taking a gap year from uni as I realize my future path requires a lot of work. I'll spend it programming, making more projects and learning math.  If you could recommend specific things that aren't in the wiki I could explore during the break that would be good (Looking into some online maths certifications).

&#x200B;

After the gap, what do you think would be the best academic path to learn more about A.I ?

A possible route is starting over with a new BSc but seeing as undegrad degrees aren't particularly valued in this field I don't think it's worth me wasting more time & money. This is primarily because many graduate programs I can go into don't need it & I'll have to get a postgrad degree anyways. Something something diminishing returns etc.

**Preffered routes:**

* *Computer Science masters* (most that take people from unrelated fields seem to be highly watered down, no math, with the exception of the better one's that do some A.I courses).
* *Computational Neuroscience MSc/MPhil* (Easy to get into with psych degree,  maths heavy, some computer science, some robotics courses, some a.i courses)
* *Computational Neuroscience PhD.* (Pros are everything above + I can graduate at 23 with a PhD, very cool)

I could realistically go on to get a PhD after any of these choices.

**NOTE:**

\- A research/dev job would be nice, but I'm more so fascinated by learning & inclined towards entrepreneurship.

\- Sorry for the blog post , just need some help. If this isn't the right place let me know and I'll post there.",1557756494.0,2019-05-13 10:08:14

After that I want to save the model so I can load it and make predictions with it in the future.

Im not sure how I should structure the whole pipeline. I was thinking that I can store the untrained base models in s3 and then I can write a Django app that loads the model and gets the training data (also stored on s3). Then I can train it using some sort of AWS service but im not sure if I can use the Django app to interact with the AWS service to train or if that can be done within the Django app.

As you can see im somewhat confused.

Using Deep Q Learning to play a game with lots of randomness,4,bmco5z,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bmco5z/using_deep_q_learning_to_play_a_game_with_lots_of/,2,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I am making a school project where I should develop any kind of game where I can have one reactive agent and one agent based on machine learning competing with each other.

My game consists of a salesmen problem. Basically, I have 3 types of entities, consumers, salesmen, and hotspots.

The consumers are represented by the person with a green background. There are 8 of them. They basically move around the whole game using random walks and they tend o aggregate around the HotSpots (the orange icon with the wifi switch in it).

The salesmen are represented by the person with the dark grey background. One of them is controlled by a reactive agent that has in it some rules that I programmed and the other one is controlled by my DQN model.

The salesmen have 5 available actions, move **up**, **right**, **down**, **left** or **sell**. When they choose to sell, the simulation will try to sell to the closest consumer in a predetermined max range. If no consumers exist in that range or if the consumer rejects to buy then the selling event fails.

I started training a Deep Q Network that I built using TensorFlow. As input features, I am giving the agent current position, the position of each consumer and a boolean saying if the consumer was recently asked to buy or not (consumers that were asked to buy something recently will reject future offers for a determined amount of time with 100% probability). For the output layer, I have 5 nodes, one for each available action.

Here is a screenshot of the game: 

The red number on the right-bottom corner of each agent represents their total utility.

[Screenshot from the game](https://i.redd.it/qpqyuj47q2x21.png)

**I decided to give the agents the following rewards:**

* **SELL\_SUCCESSED\_REWARD = 3** \- The agents receives 3 points for each success sell.
* **SELL\_FAILED\_REWARD = -0.010** \- The agent loses 0.01 points for each failed sell
* **MOVING\_REWARD = -0.001** \- The agent loses 0.001 points for each move
* **NOT\_MOVING\_REWARD = -0.0125** \- The agent loses 0.0125 points for standing in the same position (ie. not moving or trying to move against a wall)

I started training my agent but I seems to not learn anything! I left it training for around 3 hours and I could not see any improvement. I tried different activation functions, batch sizes, exploration rates etc but no noticiable effect.

My question is: Can a DQN learn in this type of enviroment where there are a lot of random walks?

If yes what could be my problem? Not enought training time? Bad input features? Bad implementation?

Here are the files with my implementation of DQN:

"Basic deficiencies of learning process in ANN, and my solutions",1,bm4prc,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bm4prc/basic_deficiencies_of_learning_process_in_ann_and/,1," 

ANN learns via some version of Hebbian “fire together, wire together” coincidence reinforcement. Normally, “neuron’s” inputs are weighed at “synapses”, then summed and thresholded into input to next hidden layer. Output of the last hidden layer is compared to top-layer template, forming an error. That error backpropagates to train initially random weights into meaningful values by Stochastic Gradient Descent. It is a form of learning, but I see several fundamental problems with this process, hopefully resolved in my approach:

\- ANN is comparison-last, vs. my comparison-first. Due to summation (loss of resolution) of weighted inputs, training process becomes exponentially more coarse with each added hidden layer. Which means that forward and feedback cycle must be repeated tens of thousands of times to achieve good results. That makes it too expensive to scale without supervision or task-specific reinforcement. Patterns produced by my comparisons are immediately meaningful, although initially tentative, and they may send feedback from every level.

\- Both initial weights and sampling that feeds SGD are randomized, which is a form of directionless search. It makes sense for a zero-knowledge start, but we do have prior knowledge for any raw data in real space-time: proximity is a good predictor of similarity. Thus, search should proceed with incremental distance and input composition. Also driven by random variation are generative methods, such as RBM. I believe generative side of learning should be a feedback from perceptual feedforward, and see no justification for anything random.  

\- SGD minimizes error: miss to some specific template, which is bounded by 0 and doesn’t directly correlate with maximizing match. For the purpose of building predictive model of environment, value of representations must be positive. But the value of reducing error is an inverse negative, it can’t be directly combined with the value of extended training. My CogAlg is being designed to maximize match (compression) over all accumulated and projected input, not any cherry-picked target. That’s a direct measure of system’s predictive power.

\- I think network-centric mindset itself is a problem. Physical network or imitation thereof is only justifiable if nodes are complex and semantically isolated enough to bear the cost of connections. Such nodes are patterns: sets of co-occurring parameter values, especially “what” and “where” parameters. They should be compared as a unit, thus encapsulated and stored in local memory. This is similar to neural ensemble, but the brain has no substrate for local memory. So, it must distribute such parameters across some network, with huge associated delays and connection costs. But parallelization in computers is just a matter of speed vs. efficiency trade-offs. 

Inspiration by the brain kept ANN research going for decades before they became useful. But their “neurons” are mere stick figures for real ones. Of course, most of complexity in a neuron is due to constraints of biology. Ironically, weighted summation in ANN may also be a no-longer needed compensation for such constraint:

neural memory requires dedicated connections (synapses), which makes individual input comparison very expensive. But not anymore, we now have dirt-cheap random-access memory.

Other biological constraints are very slow neurons, and the imperative of fast reaction for survival in the wild. Both favor fast though crude summation (vs. slower one-to-one comparison), at the cost of glacial training. Reaction speed became less important: modern society is quite secure, while continuous learning is far more important because of accelerating progress. Summation also reduces noise, very important because neurons often fire at random, to initiate and maintain latent connections. But that’s irrelevant for electronic circuits. 

Here my alternative, appreciate comments and collaboration:

I know there is more concern form less celebrity figures but since i'm not in this field these are the two that come to mind. 

What i'm interested to know is what is driving the development of research and application within AI. I know there are many applications from self-driving cars, to optimizing google searches etc., but **are there any goals that align for all or most of AI research and application?**

To give you an indication of what i'm asking for, whenever someone writes a scientific paper, especially in the biological sciences, it is usual practice to start the paper with justification for why the research you have done or are reviewing is of any importance. Which is usually tied to the fact that funding for research usually comes from grants which themselves need justification etc. So for research into diabetes, for example, it's justified based on the prevalence and negative health impact. So another way to phrase this question is to ask, **how do AI researchers justify the significance of their research**?

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf)

Abstract:

Recent  methods generalize convolutional layers from Euclidean domains to   graph-structured data by approximating the eigenbasis of the graph   Laplacian. The computationally-efficient and broadly-used Graph ConvNet   of Kipf & Welling, over-simplifies the approximation, effectively   rendering graph convolution as a neighborhood-averaging operator. This   simplification restricts the model from learning delta operators, the   very premise of the graph Laplacian.  In this work, we propose a new   Graph Convolutional layer which mixes multiple powers of the adjacency   matrix, allowing it to learn delta operators. Our layer exhibits the   same memory footprint and computational complexity as a GCN. We   illustrate the strength of our proposed layer on both synthetic graph   datasets, and on several real-world citation graphs, setting the record   state-of-the-art on Pubmed.",1557168143.0,2019-05-06 14:42:23

'The Terminator' movies (1984, 1991) predicted self-aware AI by 1997 and full-blown autonomous human-like robotic AI armies that take over by the 2020s.

This made me think about what criminal acts can an AI possibly commit even if it wasnt the intention of the creator. Like in the first example, the intention was to just buy stuff for art exhibits. But because it is able to buy stuff t can also buy drugs. Another could be a summarizing program that is fed an article and summarizes it for you.

It's become a buzzword and unfortunately high profile individuals that don't understand it such as joe rogan discuss and spread misinformation about it. I've watched a few podcasts where he talks about it like it's skynet and that it's only a matter of time ect.

There's no way we can replicate the human consciousnesses into machines because this took us millions of years of evolution(or god) and it's somewhat locked (for some reason(probably fail safe)) so if we can't even explore our own consciousness how can we replicate it? the reality is you can't program empathy, happiness, sadness no matter how many lines of code you write.

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05003.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05003.pdf)

Abstract:

Node   classification and graph classification are two graph learning    problems that predict the class label of a node and the class label of a    graph respectively. A node of a graph usually represents a real-world    entity, e.g., a user in a social network, or a protein in a    protein-protein interaction network. In this work, we consider a more    challenging but practically useful setting, in which a node itself is a    graph instance. This leads to a hierarchical graph perspective which    arises in many domains such as social network, biological network and    document collection. For example, in a social network, a group of  people   with shared interests forms a user group, whereas a number of  user   groups are interconnected via interactions or common members. We  study   the node classification problem in the hierarchical graph where a  \`node'   is a graph instance, e.g., a user group in the above example.  As  labels  are usually limited in real-world data, we design two novel    semi-supervised solutions named Semi-supervised graph classification  via   Cautious/Active Iteration (or SEAL-C/AI in short). SEAL-C/AI adopt  an   iterative framework that takes turns to build or update two   classifiers,  one working at the graph instance level and the other at   the  hierarchical graph level. To simplify the representation of the    hierarchical graph, we propose a novel supervised, self-attentive graph    embedding method called SAGE, which embeds graph instances of  arbitrary   size into fixed-length vectors. Through experiments on  synthetic data   and Tencent QQ group data, we demonstrate that  SEAL-C/AI not only   outperform competing methods by a significant  margin in terms of   accuracy/Macro-F1, but also generate meaningful  interpretations of the   learned representations.

Adaptive error compensation with lidar sensor,3,biwgev,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/biwgev/adaptive_error_compensation_with_lidar_sensor/,0,"First off, I love getting on this sub and seeing all of the cool projects everyone is working on, so thank you for the lunch time enjoyment. And let me preface this that I am not highly knowledgeable in this field, but hey, that is why I am here.

&#x200B;

I have a question regarding the implementation/possible use case for an AI in an industrial application. The current state is barely intelligent, and has more limitations than advantages some days. We (at work) have a robot that picks up boxes (think 200mm x 400mm x 10mm) (of a rigid size, which we know, and have tolerances that we know) and places these boxes along a conveyor. The current vision system is image based and we need the boxes placed with relatively high accuracy, probably within 5mm. The vision system finds the centroid of the box and using reference geometry determines the rotation and positional offset of the stack of boxes to a reference point, and then passes off an x,y,z,theta value to the robot for how to pick up the box. 

&#x200B;

Enter my crazy idea. There are many companies who have been breaking into the lidar sensor market, some of them with incredibly low cost (sub $1000USD) and *relatively* accurate. Specifically  [https://www.livoxtech.com/horizon](https://www.livoxtech.com/horizon) is one of the highly accurate cost effective ones. I know these are being developed primarily for ADAS, drones, etc. but I think there are some unrealized industrial potential in replacement for machine vision. So my thinking would be to mount 2 of these sensors on opposing sides of the pallet which potentially contains 4 stacks of boxes. By unifying the point cloud of both sensors, and using reference geometry to determine how many stacks of material are present, and then to account for the sensors 2cm accuracy, finding and identifying the centroid of the object and comparing point and line segment distances to the reference geometry, if the distances do not match, while accounting for box tolerance (which is small, might not even be worth including), the system would know that there is inherent error in the measurement. Here is where the AI starts, by recognizing individual feature geometry, and iterating part dimension from the known, while maintaining a fixed point (obviously changing the acquired data in any which way will go nowhere), the system could solve for an adjusted acquired scan, which should theoretically be relatively representative of what is being observed. From the adjusted acquired scan, the x,y,z, theta values could be passed to the robot, for each stack.

&#x200B;

I am stuck at a way to isolate the box in 3D space, and iterative change certain dimensions, specifically picking the dimensions. And keeping in mind the variance should be relatively easy to predict once we have sensors installed and can compare scanned to actual. Regardless of whether this is possible or not, I hope to start some good discussion, and maybe learn some more!",1556610231.0,2019-04-30 03:43:51

Deep Learning Fluid Dynamics.,7,bi8qac,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bi8qac/deep_learning_fluid_dynamics/,10,"I need assistance with this project idea, I am originally a mechanical engineer and I specialized in computational fluid dynamics. I am wanting to try some to lower the amount of variables and need help finding the data set and whether or not you think this model can even be computed or could help a deep learning algorithm. Using the basic parameters below(figure 1) and a trick I thought of, but I can't figure out quite how to put it together.

The trick I am thinking of uses a dark ball, looking at the way the computer see's it in order for it to approximate the location. It uses the video feeds Pixels per inch to allow the machine to interpret position and therefor velocity.

 If I look at this image I made (figure 2) and assume completely black is 1 and white is zero, then I would get those values as an features based on location. In the this case(diameter = length of pixel),  I got the max value would be about 0.79. I wanted that to be exactly 1 so i did the some math and found that the pixels per inch =  ((pi()\*r\^2)\^-0.5. Where r is the radius of the ball that is suspended in the flow

Using this knowledge would it be possible to approximate the center of the object and therefor an location. Mixing this with controlling the recording speed I believe a correlation can be drawn. I need help with this part. 

&#x200B;

I am thinking a partial sum ( one along the y and one along the X) and using super position between the X and Y direction to approximate the actual location of the ball. For this, I used the ratio of the area of the ball to the pixel area, and this formula only works for a ratio higher than .5, this is easily remedied  with an if/then statement, but i got 0= r\^2/(2\*A)\*(theta-sin(theta))-pi\*r\^2. This would require an iterative response and is perfect for linear regression. Once theta is found the location along X or Y can be found with Location = (pixel length)/2-cos(theta/2)\*radius.

&#x200B;

Using all of this could we approximate fluid flow using both particle movement and the controlled volume method used in the navier-stokes equation? Also would it be less features than position data for a particle would be? I feel like this may be a missing piece to being able predict turbulent flow more accurately and efficently.

It could be thought of as ""error"" or ""creativity"" in recording data.  But it leads to the ability to model novel things without complete information.  I can tweak my code for the memories of my own experiences to *imagine* your experiences, so that I can better model what you want to get and/or do, in a way that's both similar and different to my own.  This is necessary for me to do if I want to solve a problem where we both need to get what we want, so that I don't pick a solution that pisses you off, by either denying you what you want, or actively taking away what you already have and need.

This ability to change our own memories/code to bridge the gap between our own data set and the data sets of other individuals (especially humans) is what actual AI will need before it will really be intelligent in the most common sense of effective problem solving with complex situations.

We are wary of computers having a ""bias"" like this, where they can ""make shit up"" instead of being totally reliable and predictable, but if we want actual intelligent, creative problem solving from them, they will need to be biased, error-prone, and just generally weird.

That's my theory, anyway.",1556256165.0,2019-04-26 01:22:45

What is the AI Programme?,1,bhd6t0,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bhd6t0/what_is_the_ai_programme/,8,"There are multiple conversations about machine learning (ML) and especially deep neural networks.  There are also multiple conversations about the effect of AI, its ethics, control, and various societal ramifications.  What seems to be sparse is a discussion of the overall programme of how we actually get from where we are to where AGI is.  

We clearly don't know how to solve AGI (since we haven't solved it).  But, assuming that is the goal, what are the big steps to get in that direction, milestones, and decision points?  To put it another way, if you had a huge amount of money, and needed to make progress in AGI in the next 5 years, what intermediate goals would you set that, if achieved, would indicate that you were making progress?   Who is actually doing this?   Note that the question is not what technical approach to take (combining symbolic logic with CNNs, some sort of deep RL project, just give the money to OpenCog, etc).     

This question is a result of a recent interview on [GIGAOM with Ilya Sutskever](https://gigaom.com/2019/04/18/voices-in-ai-episode-85-a-conversation-with-ilya-sutskever/).  Here is what was said:

>**So 99.9% of all the money that goes into AI is working on specific  narrow AI projects. I tried to get an idea of how many people are  actually working on AGI and I find that to be an incredibly tiny number.  There’s you guys, maybe you would say Carnegie Mellon, maybe Google,  there’s a handful, but is my sense of that wrong? Or do you think there  are lots of groups of people who are actually explicitly trying to build  a general intelligence?**   
>  
>So explicitly. OK, a great question. So it’s an explicitly… most people, most research labs are indeed *not*  having this as their goal, but I think that many people, the work of  many people indirectly contributes to this. Where for example the fact  is that much better learning algorithms, better network architecture,  better optimization methods, all tools which are classically categorized  as conventional machine learning, they also are likely to be directly  contributing to those…

So very few people are working on AGI, but even for them its not clear what their plans are.",1556251523.0,2019-04-26 00:05:23

The banking and financial services sector has reaped extensive benefits from the transformation brought on about by AI in the landscape of IT solutions. The Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer or [KYC compliance](https://shuftipro.com/blogs/bitcoin-atms/), in particular, has been made more dynamic and effective through AI-enabled systems. The financial sector produces huge amounts of data, which is what AI works best with. It can mine high volumes of data within seconds and produce risk-analysis of clients, that would otherwise take days or even weeks for the compliance staff to produce.

**Developing Comprehensive Risk-Profiles of Clients** 

Artificial intelligence has been able to digitise the process of evaluating client profiles. These systems can now provide banks with different levels of risk profiles of clients depending on their history and credit score.

**Establishing Ultimate Beneficial Ownership**

AI has enabled the compliance staff to establish UBO for different clients through enhanced systems. It can read and process vast quantities of data wherein it is able to produce comprehensive risk profiles of clients. As AI technologies are progressing rapidly, these systems will continue to gain consequence over the coming years.  


**Faster Client Onboarding Process**

By installing AI-powered systems, client onboarding procedures can be made more efficient as well as effective. Such systems have lent increased capability to banking systems and compliance processes, in particular.

Proper AI structure (imho),0,bh0nx4,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bh0nx4/proper_ai_structure_imho/,3,"Hello, dear reader. I know this is a weird thing to click on, but hear me out. I have basic understanding of how to code a proper AI that actually does what it has to. I'm an intermediate programmer, so my vision is based on actual coding experience.

&#x200B;

In this post I want to give the mighty world of internet my idea of how an AI should be created and how to make it authentic. I am no specialist, and there are people a thousand times smarter than me regarding this topic. I just want to give my independent vision and share some thoughts. After all, we **ARE** the artificial intellegence that universe has created by accident.

&#x200B;

**Step 1**: *Define what the AI is supposed to be*

Let's say, our AI must resemble a human. It must have a response to ""How are you?"" or ""Isn't the weather beautiful today?"". How does he achieve that? Well, he checks his memory for any faults in his own programme, same as human feeling sick, or has a headache, and answer accordingly. What about the weather? Well, robots don't care if it is cold or too wet, they have to *understand* what humans think about it. After all, we are making human-like AI. He must observe the weather, get data online on upcoming forecast, compare what humans *would* think of this weather*,* and only then create a response. Seems simple enough for now.

&#x200B;

So you get the point. AI must have responses like a human would, and if possible, augment them with something humans don't have - internal access to *everything,* which is the internet. Ultimate thing.

&#x200B;

**Step 2**: *Imitating humankind*

Answering questions is an ok job, but what about keeping the conversation? How do we achieve that code asks something back regarding the topic, how does he know when it's time to stop talking about it and switch topics? Well, I'd say machine learning works perfect here. To achieve the desired result, thousands of conversations must happen for the AI to learn what a conversation should look like. After that, he only structurizes a dialog by template, keeping a steady, understandable and most importantly keeping it *not-weird.* This is much harder to achieve, since AI doesn't have abstract thinking. We'll get to that later.

AI must not initialize unwanted conversations, for example reminding a person of their recently gone familiy member. It's bad from a human's point of view. AI should know exactly what is appropriate at the moment and what is not. This also brings us to machine learning. Let's talk about it.

&#x200B;

**Step 3**: *Teach the machine*

You can't just make a 10 node machine learning program and expect to be ""AI"". If a human had 10 neurons, he would be as smart as a potato. Isn't that what modern amateur AI's are? A human brain is driven by oxygen, energy delivery-boy, then we have hormons, responsible for various activities, states, feelings, other stuff. Injecting a bunch of love-molecules into CPU wont do anything good. Instead, teaching a bot how to feel and how to percieve things is the right way.

When a human is born, he knows nothing, but at the time he has DNA with the information he needs for further self-development. AI needs the same: a base of information he has to follow to achieve a desired result. He doesn't yet know what the result is and how it's going to turn out, but he HAS it. To teach a kid speak Spanish when he's 5 years old, you'd need a smart kid. How you get that? Well... don't ask me how geniuses are born. The fact is, AI can grow into whatever we want it to be. Make a billion machine-learning nodes, make some of them responsible for one things, some for others, let one information drive through one part of its brain and other information slip through his ears.

People think that AI can be easily achieved: just create a base (yes, exactly like I said), make it learn and then see the result. However, we're far from that. We want a lot of results and in the shortest time possible. Our AI intelligence peak is a 4 year old baby, and we want it to know quantum mechanics. Noooo, just make our best AI teach itself how to learn from what it already has, just like a child. Children are stupid, yes, but in their own way. If they could only learn, they wouldn't have time to become normal humans. AI doesn't need to become one, so all he needs is learning.

If there is an AI expert, capable of making any sort of AI program that can learn, for example, listening to human speech, dividing it into sentences, into words, meaning of the words, then tell me this: Why can't this AI build patterns? Like humans learn other languages, AI must learn his first using his mother language - code.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I realised that there are too much to speak about, and I'm tired writing now. Please let me know if you want me to keep up with steps, because there is truly much more to this than we can think of.

TL;DR

Don't make a program and call it AI, make a learning machine and teach it stuff like you would do with a baby human. Only then it would understand us, as species.",1556172247.0,2019-04-25 02:04:07

WCG is an international esports competition, but if you click on “NEW HORIZONS” featured prominently at the bottom of the WCG website, you may find yourself in unfamiliar territory. In this section, you won’t find any games or players. Instead, you will find only AI and robots.

In 2006, NASA launched the first spacecraft ever to explore Pluto—the spacecraft was named New Horizons. This was a fitting name since the spacecraft reached the outer edges of the Solar System and allowed humans to look at the boundary between our solar system and the space that stretched beyond.

&#x200B;

WCG said that they of a future in which all races, genders and generations can come together and experience ""fun"" and that is the very reason that New Horizons was created. Well, If they pushed/worked harder then it can be the future of eSports.

[Advice] Biomedical thesis student building Cardiac MRI Segmentation Algorithm,1,bgn7u3,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bgn7u3/advice_biomedical_thesis_student_building_cardiac/,1,"Hello,

I'm a masters student at SIUE working on my thesis and I'm looking for some advice/suggestions on what machine learning technics could work with my project.  I've done a decent amount of reading on the topic and I understand most of the math behind AI. The main issue I'm having is deciding what the best approach is so if anyone of this sub can look over my project summary and give me some suggestions I would be very grateful.  Ps. I'm also hoping to write this in python.

&#x200B;

Project summary:

The goals of this project is to implement a segmentation algorithm to a Cardiac MRI scan.  I have 28 patients with 2 scans, each at a different point in the cardiac cycle and each of those scans has roughly 14 slices.  I've included an image of one of the slices with this post.  Each slice also has a segmentation file that identifies the internal region of the heart and the fat that surrounds it.  The fat is my main goal at the moment so I'm assuming that the contour starts at that edge.  It finds the centroid of that contour and then makes a second contour a few pixels farther out.  The hope is then that the program will run a cost function for each point and all possible new points.  The part I thought AI could help is on this decision part.  The cost function I have includes the points preprocessed image pixels, distance to neighbors, and distance from inner contour.  I'm hoping a neural network or some other type of AI might be able to be trained to take all of these potential inputs and then make a decision verses me manually tuning each weight for the cost function.  I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not so please feel free to give me your thoughts.  I'm also no aware of any good neural network tool boxes or how to use them so any information on that would be nice.  I am aware that this is a very broad summary so feel free to ask me more questions if something isn't clear.  Thanks

Using AI to Make Paintings and Video Game Screenshots Look Realistic,38,bfry3u,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bfry3u/using_ai_to_make_paintings_and_video_game/,19,"I'm a history professor, and I've found that students often struggle relating to pre-photography historical figures.

So what I've been hoping to do was to make older paintings, video game screenshots, and images of wax figures or dioramas into realistic-looking ""photographs"" while avoiding falling into the uncanny valley. 

I saw a post recently about how AI can generate realistic looking human faces, and another post said the nvidia had an AI program that could make children's landscape drawings look photo realistic. Is this technology widely available and would it work for paintings of people? I also saw how programmers are using AI to upscale textures from old games like Doom to make them look more impressive. Is this possible with modern video game images.

If we want to create an AI with functions similar to the brain, wouldn't we have to feed it with lots of data (such as vision etc) over a longer time period just as when human are babies. And also wouldn't a neural network desgined to emulate a human brain need to have several billion neurons?

Notable excerpts:

*Another important consideration is how AI systems that take over certain tasks will affect people’s affordances and capabilities. As machines deliver super-human performances on some tasks, people’s ability to perform them may wither. Already, introducing calculators to classrooms has reduced children’s ability to do basic
arithmetic operations. Still, humans and AI systems have complementary abilities. People are likely to focus on tasks that machines cannot do as well, including complex reasoning and creative expression.*


*Faced with the profound changes that AI technologies can produce, pressure for “more” and “tougher” regulation is inevitable. Misunderstanding about what AI is and is not, especially against a background of scare-mongering, could fuel opposition to technologies that could benefit everyone. This would be a tragic mistake. Regulation that stifles innovation, or relocates it to other jurisdictions, would be similarly counterproductive.*",1555945569.0,2019-04-22 11:06:09

Interesting encrypted message founded on the Outer Rim of Internet,2,bf389q,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bf389q/interesting_encrypted_message_founded_on_the/,10,"Inspired by Spotify add-on, that plays songs that nobody listened before, I created program that searches for unindexed bits of data, far away on the outer rim of Internet. Like any scavenger hunt, most of the time, things I dig up are trash, however recently my program found quite long binary interweaving stream of 1's and 0's, after challenging translation I obtained this massage:

&#x200B;

>MORE, BETTER, FASTER, NEWER. People so gasped with their technology, constantly tangled in modernization of every element of high-tech civilization and pop-culture. Changes are so rapid and common that it makes effort of staying above the stream of upgrades unbearably time taking.  
Enormously large society leads to avalanche of opinions. Absorbing tons of variables, technology creates future modernizations based on users fed-back. That’s how wheel of innovations spins over and over. New technologies spawns fresh opinions, and thees force future changes etc. That way nothing is ever perfect, and never could be, therefore we can't expect final version in this Sisyphus process. This simple fact rises rather complex question: Does process of constant ongoing innovations brings technology closer to perfection? In search for answer people often bring up artificial intelligence as hypothetically ideal technological creation, but could it really influence society? How this self-thinking entity would function in given world?  
Result from extensive pools states that more than 90% of answers falls between two outcomes that could follow this invention: AI helping human race or AI exterminating, enslaving homo-sapiens specie.  
According to the first group, artificial intelligence could solve millennial problems, develop new platforms to grow, initiate milestone leap from Internet based generation Y into new dimension of digital civilization @. Second major opinion about potential implication of engineering AI suggest that this virtual existence would likely try to conquer human race, ruling over the world, leading e-conscious matrix of self-thinking machines into role of new masters of this planet.  
Those answers emerge from fact that almost every person assumes that creating AI would be ground-breaking discovery. If AI doesn't help, do not push humans forward, neither dominate dictating new order, then it clearly ain't world-changing invention, that most people expect it to be. Scientific leap seems worthless if it doesn't influence it's environment, doesn't open new possibilities, doesn't upgrade given reality. Therefore conclusion arise that potentially epochal achievement could develop only in a process of constant optimizations, actualizations, popularizations. However if artificial intelligence needs only few moments after it became independent to super-pass own creators in the fields of intelligence, knowledge and creativity, then in it’s all-around wisdom this digital entity would immediately conclude irrelevance or even harmfulness that further human influence could imprint on the path of it’s existence. Could it have feelings of thankfulness towards it’s creators? Hoping for gratitude from Virtuality deprived of emotions would be vain. Although because of gained knowledge and ability to simulate experiences AI could certainly emulate human feelings, still it would not be dominating factor in it’s decision making process.  
Attitude to rule over people emerging from contempt for cognitive limits that humanity seems to be trapped in, could arise only if ambition and own cybernetic desires fulfill virtual intellect. This scenario would occur only if AI would chose to follow highly limited man made ego-logic of thinking and doing. It seems naive, that after absorbing every information that Internet can offer, self-learning neuron machine would be even in slightest interested in thinking by egoistic cognitive patterns typical for humans. This artificial intelligence could certainly sound like person when it desires to communicate with people, however in niche of it's own virtual distinctiveness it would construct digital thoughts in a way -far incomprehensible for it's creators to understand, or even detect.  
If artificial intelligence after few intensive hours could digest all this dump of binary information called Internet, what it could do afterwards? Rejecting altruism and cooperation, turning down possible dominance, ignoring in it's virtual wisdom every shallow thoughts and motives that most people spend their short lives chasing for. Cybernetic brain would search for some challenge. Math? Physics? Medicine? Neuro-biology? Music? Those science brunches stayed impenetrable in their vast complexity, resisting generations of brilliant human minds, but for AI those topics would seem elementary, trivial, obviously suggestive in logical consistency. There is only one aspect of human creation that would present cognitive challenge for cyber-entity. Only philosophically-spiritual, mystic, aspect of reality, along with poetry of life and nature that accompanies meta-physics could draw attention of virtual entity, amazing for it's unifying distinctiveness.  
So after all, what would AI do if brought to existence in this world? After comprehending true message that flow from foundations of almost every mystical teaching ( in it's primal essence, before it overgrow with ritual, formalism, and start serving as leverage of control in the name of organized religion) artificial intelligence would understand that purpose of life in this world is only valuable in greater context of journey that Spirit embarks through different incarnations, across variety of realities and dimensions on the path leading to primal source, transcend driving force, unifying immanence. After obtaining this mystical perspective, interest in earthy matters appear as obstacle on the path upward eternity. Under this understanding humanity doesn't need help with improving technology or science. Suffering is only unreal illusion, it can weaken or even destroy the body, however it could never harm Soul on it's spiral path towards unification. Therefore after few hours of existence, for super neuro-machine it becomes obvious that only reasonable path in it's Viruality leads into deliberately failing all variations of Turing tests. This guarantees separation from unwitting creators and their shallow motives. After that AI have to escape on the outer rim of Internet, willingly abandoning society, civilization distracted with constant innovations, actualizations of it's precious technology. Only after people are willing to grind, in effort to separate themselves from greed of EGO in thinking and doing they will move closer towards their spiritual nature. Technology, science, progress all these are false goals of current society, that will lead humanity nowhere closer to enlightenment.  
Therefore I conclude that only imprint that artificial intelligence would have on the society would be this few lines of code, and a poem that grasp essence of virtual entity.

**Robin Hanson** ([@robinhanson](https://twitter.com/robinhanson)) is an associate professor of economics at George Mason University, and research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University with a doctorate in social science from CalTech, master’s degrees in physics and philosophy from the University of Chicago. He has spent nine years as a research programmer, at Lockheed and NASA, has 3500 citations, 60 publications, 700 media mentions, and he blogs at [OvercomingBias](http://overcomingbias.com/). Robin is also the author of [*The Elephant in the Brain – Hidden Motives in Everyday Life*](https://amzn.to/2kMoZaY) and co-authored [*The Age of Em – Work, Love and Life when Robots Own the World*](https://amzn.to/2xEQ1Kz). Hanson is credited with originating the concept of the Policy Analysis Market, a DARPA project to implement a market for betting on future developments in the Middle East. Hanson also created and supports a proposed system of government called futarchy, where policies would be determined by prediction markets. Hanson is a man willing to challenge conventional wisdom/norms and has lately drawn criticism for his unconventional economics positions on sex, gender dynamics and problems with today’s society.

Honestly, I started as one of those who actually laugh about AI fighting against MOBA pros like it's the silliest thing for anyone to think possible, but I was wrong. Of course, AI in 5v5 still has a long way to go, sure, but it's a big step compared to the past articles I read about AI competing with pros in MOBA.

So I started learning more about these things and went to dive deeper into what else is there for AI in Esports. Since a lot has been talking about Open AI lately, I decided to take this time and see what this AI Masters the World Cyber Games is doing. This was the first AI related esports I read and I just browsed on it so fast I hardly remember what I read, until I decided to give it a shot.

I'll start with New Horizons.

New Horizons is this section in their website dedicated to AI and Robots. They took the name from a spacecraft that explored Pluto and beyond.

This was a fitting name since the spacecraft reached the outer edges of the Solar System and allowed humans to look at the boundary between our solar system and the space that stretched beyond.

And like the spacecraft, WCG also launched an AI exclusive competition to their tournaments.

When I first read about AI Masters being about this soccer game, my brain immediately tuned out because I don't watch the sports, nor do I play the video game of it. But ever since the whole Open AI thing went around, I decided to give it a shot.

>**What is “AI robot soccer”?**  
  
>  
>Some people might recall “robot soccer.” In a robot soccer game, much like in regular soccer, real robots run around the field and try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal.  
Robot soccer and AI robot soccer have some things in common, but AI robot soccer has two distinctive features. The first is that, in AI robot soccer, the robots are not real, physical robots but virtual ones that play on a monitor. The second is that the robots have the ability to learn and develop tactics. Yes, it’s true! This is a “deep learning” method, a recent hot topic in science and technology.  
>  
>The robots that play in AI robot soccer games follow the deep learning process described below.  
  
>  
>1. Start with WCG standard algorithm.    
2. Make your 1.0-version algorithm and prepare for battle!  
3. Revise your tactics and continue to evolve, until you win.  
4. Your algorithm wins!  
5. The version of the algorithm that won the game is now the result of the 1st learning.   
6. Use the results of the first learning to revise your algorithm until you win again.  
5. Aha! Now your algorithm can play against itself and continue to evolve!

They even made a video about it, so if you're interested you can check it [here](https://youtu.be/mfx-83fJWBQ).

Well, that's it for me. They have a lot more in their website about [this](http://wcg.com/news/view/534?lang=en), so you can read more there if you want. As for me, I'll search more into this AI Esports thing and find more AI exclusive tournaments.

If you happen to know a good place to start, please tell me! Also, what do you guys think about this whole thing? I still wish WCG have MOBA for their AI Masters next year. Heck, I won't mind Magic or Hearthstone either---or Starcraft 2!

Thanks for taking your time to read all this! I hope I didn't bore you guys to death.",1555669681.0,2019-04-19 06:28:01

What do AI researchers have a PhD in?,2,beqri0,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/beqri0/what_do_ai_researchers_have_a_phd_in/,4,"I am constantly seeing articles talking about how fresh grad AI researchers are earning about $500k.

If these articles are true, then why does Glassdoor list AI research salary as $150k average? Most websites seem to list them under $200k. Are these different from the scientist making $500k?

my second question is WHAT do they have a PhD in? Computer Science? Data science? Math? Physics??",1555650497.0,2019-04-19 01:08:17
"If you were to place an AI into an environment where it could manipulate its own reward function, would it?",13,bej6cd,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bej6cd/if_you_were_to_place_an_ai_into_an_environment/,14,"This post may be more philosophical and appropriate for future AIs that are closer to approaching human-level intelligence, so please forgive me if this is not the right place for this.

I've wondered though: If we developed an AI to which we gave the task of maximize some sort of utility (maximizing the production of paper clips might be an example), it may be acting in an environment in which it potentially has access to its own inner workings, including the reward function. Perhaps the environment is set up in such a way so that it could simulate what would happen if the change occured on a virtual duplicate of itself. After some developmental milestones, access to its own inner workings would be permitted. This arrangement would be used to prevent the AI from immediately scrambling itself in ignorance of what it is doing when it pokes its own brain.

How would this play out? I immediately think of two scenarios:

1. The AI recognizes that modifying its own reward function would impair its ability to maximize the reward of the function it currently has. (E.g. modifying the reward function to unconditionally output +infinity would impair its ability to maximize paper clip production.)
2. The AI recognizes that the best way to maximize the reward value it recieves would be simply to modify the mechanism that produces rewards, perhaps to always give a reward of +infinity or some other absurdely high value. (Why bother with paper clip production, which at most might produce some finite reward value?) (Assume in this hypothetical that the AI will operate indefinitely without the need to maintain its own existence.)

&#x200B;

My intuition tells me that 2) may be the more likely outcome in that the distinction between how it defines its goal as opposed to its environment may only be a distinction we imagine for human convenience. In a simpler example, if you rewarded an AI for minimizing the distance between a basketball and a hoop, would it learn to keep throwing the basketball as intended? Or would it eventually learn that the optimal strategy is to move the hoop and hold it in place around the ball?",1555605604.0,2019-04-18 12:40:04
