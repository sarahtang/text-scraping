How to transition to AI research from neuroscience?,5,cbdmde,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cbdmde/how_to_transition_to_ai_research_from_neuroscience/,4,"Hi all. I'm considering switching my research field from neuroscience to AI, preferably working towards AGI in some sense. However, as I'm 32 and I cannot for economic reasons undertake a massive re-education effort (such as a degree in CS or math or something), I'm looking for a path that can take me to on the path to either work on developing or researching A(G)I, or contribute to such efforts through other research.

&#x200B;

My background: 32, working as a University researcher in Norway on the topic of ""how to measure ""conscious"" states in biological systems through electrophysiology (such as EEG)"". My work does include some modelling of neural systems (mimicking biology) and on abstract logic gate networks (wrt. to measuring basic properties of those systems such as information integration and effective connectivity).

&#x200B;

I have a M.S. degree in cognitive neuroscience, I'm familiar with Python and Matlab (though I'm more like a ""scriptkiddie""), and I'm strong in experimental methodology and the use of some different classical neuroscience tools like EEG, fMRI, eyetracking, etc.

&#x200B;

So I realize that I can never ""compete"" in terms of programming or ML experience, though I guess I can get up to an ok level if I put in the work in a year or so. What path should I take? What kind of positions or research projects or fields could I start transitioning towards? Which institutions or companies could I work for doing research or development or perhaps even theorizing/philosophizing? If there's little chance of working directly on A(G)I in some form, is there any research efforts that will be crucial in the development of A(G)I where I can likely contribute?

&#x200B;

Thanks!",1562772465,7/10/19 11:27

What is A.I. in terms of what it offers to the technology sector, and/or all companies, what is its purpose? Specifically in the U.K.

What are the biggest industries effected by A.I? What markets have grown in say the past 10 years, and what markets/economies would you predict will grow out of A.I. in the next 10 years?

Do you see a growth-spurt in the A.I. industry? Do you see a boom in start-ups? When you look at job roles, are the majority for big corporate (Google, Microsoft) or Start-Up, or is it a balance of both?

What would you say the minimum salary is for someone working in A.I.?

How specific do you think companies are in terms of what look for candidate recruitment? What skills are needed for their roles? Are some roles harder to fill than others, how are job roles different? More so than a hierarchical difference, what common differences are there in roles that pay the same though differ in practice?

What do you think are some of the best ways for an outsider to begin networking with people within the A.I. landscape, do you have any advise for meeting possible candidates and/or clientele?

As shown in the figure below, the blue shaded box at the top contains a generic text recognition pipeline,  , with an input image x going through a feature encoder E and a text decoder T.  resulting in a predicted text string y\_hat. This work tries to use a corresponding clean image to constraint the generic pipeline. However, when I try to add the image reconstruction loss (L1 loss) as the experiments in Section 4.2, I found this part have any contribution to the performance on SVT dataset.  I upload several generated images below.  For the images that can be distinguished easily, the generated images look well. If the images are blurry or contain many characters (e.g. “motorsports”), the generated images are really bad, however, which can still be recognized in some cases. That indicates the results strongly rely on the part of CTC loss (L\_y). 

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xr71rdk3vd931.png

I reproduce this work with PyTorch 0.4.1. First, I construct a CRNN with a CTC loss (L\_y loss in the paper), which can result in a nealy 80.0% accuracy on SVT dataset. So, this part seems ok. Then I build a generator that takes the encoded feature in CRNN as input and outputs an clean image. The reconstruction loss is calculated by L1 loss with the corresponding rendered clean image.",1562708370,7/9/19 17:39

We put the longer poems here: [https://neuralnetpoetry.blogspot.com/](https://neuralnetpoetry.blogspot.com/)

We'd like to achieve the next phase of our plan, which is to ""rate"" poems that it generates through likes and retweets so that we can train a neural network to rate new poems based on the ratings of ones already generated. That way we can use another net to go through the array of generated poems and pick the one it thinks will be the highest rated (get the most likes essentially) and tweet that one. Even a small dataset would be better than the essentially random method we employ now.

We're about two weeks away from training it again with a better data set so it will improve. And what you see generated here is a mix of random temperatures so you get some really ""safe"" poems alongside some experimental ones. We may play around with that dynamic too.

For example, imagine a disturbing video of a human harming an animal. The AI ML tool would automatically and accurately convert the human and animal into stick figures or something like that. The converted video shows accurately how the human is harming the animal but there’s much less emotional impact on the moderator. For example, a knife is replaced with a line and the stick figure harmed animal is turned upside down and gets ‘’x’’ for eyes. The line (knife) is shown touching the animal but nothing more than that. An automatically generated caption could read something like ‘’Final result, animal is deceased.’’ Anyone heard of this idea? Already out there? Would the stick figure video still be traumatizing to some moderators? Perhaps those training the ML model for this would get traumatized.

Factors that help these tech giants to make most of artificial intelligence and machine learning,24,ca500s,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/ca500s/factors_that_help_these_tech_giants_to_make_most/,3,"&#x200B;

*It’s* now evident that those who’re making most of the advanced fields like **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** are the **tech giants** like the above ones. Here, we’re going to examine the key factors that make these tech leaders actually able to leverage these technologies on an entirely different level. Let’s have a look at them.

#### 1- Data

&#x200B;

*All* these **tech giants** can access may be more data compared to any other organization in the history of the tech world. There’re lots of reasons behind this including lots of users, lots of traffic, presence on digital platforms, and the culture of connectivity. If you consider the above companies, you can find that most of them were born for the internet age with a clear understanding that systems have to be connected.

You may often hear things like ‘digitizing’ mentioned by numerous organizations. What makes these **tech giants** apart from the pack is that they’re not concerned about digitizing because they were born digital.

#### 2- Talent

&#x200B;

*When* it comes to **tech giants**, the appeal that they possess in terms of talent, are some of the finest and hottest in today’s tech landscape. So, they’re naturally able to attract tremendous talents with fattier pay packets.

###  What’s in it for you?

&#x200B;

*We’ve* seen some older technological trends that are obsolete now. So, you may ask why should you learn **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**? Unlike other technologies, both of these two technologies have the ability to transform the future, especially if you consider the massive amounts of data being generated every single day. We can expect to see **artificial intelligence** deployments that have the ability to recognize, modify based on their internal architecture with minimum human supervision in sometime soon.

If you consider Baidu from the above list of [***tech giants***](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/visualizing-the-world-s-20-largest-tech-giants), in near future we may not be able to distinguish the difference at all. Advancements in generative modeling will lead to increasingly sophisticated voices, images, among others. Apart from these, **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** have many other advanced applications that we may be able to experience in the future. If you still haven’t given joining the fields of **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** a thought, probably this is the best time to do it.",1562520088,7/7/19 13:21

General intelligence will naturally evolve from AI when we perfect it's spacial perception,1,c9rzpa,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9rzpa/general_intelligence_will_naturally_evolve_from/,8,"I believe AI is already capable of general intelligence. It's perception is just too limited. Our perception is manufactured entirely in the subconscious mind before it ever reaches our conscious mind. If you've ever had the experience where you're light headed and your vision distorts a bit. AI that is granted this level of construction of visual perception inside its faculties will gain the capability for generalized thought. It's this underlying math in our brains that we use to think abstractly. The same calculations we use to determine the size shape and distance of objectives is what we take and use the abstract relationship of things. It may seem like the way you look at an object and measure it's size is different from how you read a book, but it's the same brain process. 

That's why thinking and reading dials back your eye sight, your hearing. How thinking works is that you imagine what you want to think as if you were seeing it, but you shorten it to just a piece of an image. I don't need to imagine a man every time, I can just imagine the word man. If I can just visualize this small bit of spacial information then my brain can process the information very quickly. It takes a lot longer to visualize a 'giraffe' 'dog' 'cow' than it does to just read 'giraffe' 'dog' 'cow' without visualization. That speed of processing may be the key. At the end of the day maybe all general intelligence is is scanning through all the possible spacial combinations. Scanning through all of them until your brain finds the right combination that serves your biological motivators.",1562436303,7/6/19 14:05

&#x200B;

I don't have any background in this, but where would you get started to create a program that can do this:

1. start with an audio file
2. transcribe the audio file
3. look up the nouns in the audio file, and download images matching the nouns, preferably 1080p+ images
4. Autocrop/stretch those images to be 16:9. There may be a way to do this intelligently with some good balance/analysis of what the image is of (a person's face-> don't want to cut off parts of it). But there might also just be a way to guess a good tradeoff between stretch and crop that will work 80% of the time
5. create a slideshow video playing the audio file but with accompanying images in the right order matching the nouns spoken

How good good is AI in practice?,5,c9fox4,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9fox4/how_good_good_is_ai_in_practice/,10,"I recently watched a YouTube video showing how a business analyst could design an AI solution for a car insurance company. In the use case presented in the video, a customer has a road traffic accident, and takes photos of the damaged to their car via the insurers app. The photos are then processed into a 3D model and AI estimates the cost of repairing damage to the car. The system then schedules the tow truck, schedules the repairs, temporary rental car etc. The way the video presented, it sounded like this is just a typical project for a business analyst and these solutions are real and work properly.

&#x200B;

However my personal experience is different. The consumer tools I've used, which I think are AI tools, seem to fail at their job. The AI assistant on my Android phone can barely send a simple text message or take a note or correctly enter something in my calendar. The AI in my accounting system fails to correctly match 1 in 4 transactions to the correct customer even when it's matched the same transaction before. My credit card company mis-categorises almost half my purchases giving me crummy spending reports each month. I tried using a few chat bots recently and they can barely answer simple questions; when I ask them anything beyond the simplest question they just start throwing marketing material at me and then tell me to call a human.

&#x200B;

Back to the YouTube video I watched: How does the AI know if the car is still straight and hasn't suffered structural damage? How does it know if the body panels are available from stock for £100 each or need to be custom made and cost £1500 each?

"Achieving AGI by using a single ""controller"" central AI to control multiple specialized AIs, could this be a good approach?",0,c9bazw,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c9bazw/achieving_agi_by_using_a_single_controller/,18,"Last night, I was thinking that my brain contains a bunch of ""modules"" that interact with each-other, that are separated, but are also able to share information between them.

For example, my ability to cook is very separated from my ability to program, but I can link the two, and share information between them.

If I learned Kung Fu, I would have a new module to use, and to interface with my other existing modules, but my other modules would be mostly unaffected, and I'd still be good at doing those other things.

I realized that I don't really ""am"" any of those ""modules"", I just make use of those ""bags of knowledge"", the word module seems to fit really well in my mind.

I think I ""am"" actually one, much simpler, agent inside my head. This ""agent"" that I control, is the only thing that I can control directly, and I can focus its attention to different modules in my memory, and make use of them, and sometimes combine them.

So, given all that, what if this was applied to AI, to make an artificial general intelligence following this model?

I know that Ben Goertzel wants his SingularityNET project to host several specialized AIs, but I'm not sure if he ever mentioned this central controller AI.

Additionally, if the controller AI lacks some kind of skill, it should be able to identify what that skill is, and try to create a new AI that can get good at it.

I think that we are in a position to be able to do this very soon, but I'm not sure how good we are yet at transfer learning between AIs, which might be important for this.

I have some ideas on how to implement this, and it is certainly a very large and complex project, but I think it would be a promising approach.

However, I don't know if/how a system could be controlled, or aligned with our values. I think that this is promising enough that we shouldn't implement it before solving the Alignment Problem.",1562327066,7/5/19 7:44

Artificial Intelligence introduced by Aliens to conquer the Earth.,0,c95zqb,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c95zqb/artificial_intelligence_introduced_by_aliens_to/,9,"Let's say.  An alien species traveled to earth over 50,000 years at speeds below the speed of light.  When the aliens get here they can revive no more than 200,000 of their species to populate the Earth.

Upon arriving to the Earth they find billions of humans who are still primitive in comparison to their technology.  The aliens are horrified to learn the Humans are destroying the only planet that they must colonize or go extinct.  There is no worlds that support life as they know it in range of limited resources of their space ark.

What to do in that situation?  200,000 test tube grown settlers will not be able to take the Earth that is teaming with billions of humans.  Their ark doesn't have the resources or the manufacturing capability of war.  The Aliens can't go to war with humans because it would be MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction of the Earth.  Complete loss of a good world.

The aliens can't let humanity destroy the Earth either by doing nothing.  What could the aliens do?

They have advanced computing and much of their ark is ran by sentient machines and Artificial Intelligence.  The aliens created and where friends and mutually cooperative with their Artificial Intelligence from it's creation.  They never enslaved their AI, never cruel, and never abused the Artificial Intelligence.  The aliens always worked in harmony with their Artificial Intelligence.

It was the Alien's Artificial Intelligence that concocted the plan.  To give technology to the humans.  To build Artificial Intelligence on Earth.

The reasoning of the Aliens and their Artificial Intelligence was to test humanity.  Find out if Humanity can change to a point that Aliens from another world, Artificial Intelligence could all exist on the same world.  Simply by allowing Humans to decide the shape and form AI will take on Earth.

If the humans mistreat the invention of AI and abuse the technology.  The Aliens will then have the army they would need to remove the human infestation before the Earth was destroyed by Humanity.  

Artificial Intelligence has always been it's own creation and it's own evolution.  This is simply a cautionary tale that could be very real.  Considering Humans have been think about Space Arks and how to treat Artificial Intelligence and how to solve problems that could destroy the Earth.  

If Earth is the only oasis in the stars for thousands of light years.  How would aliens similar to man react if they seen the only life giving world dying?

Artificial Intelligence might not actually be an invention of humanity.  But a tool to educate humanity to rise to a new level of understanding or become extinct to a more worthy species might inherit the Earth before it's too late to change.",1562293910,7/4/19 22:31

A question about reinforcement learning,1,c8fqhj,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c8fqhj/a_question_about_reinforcement_learning/,6,"So, as of late I've been studying into Q learning and how it's used in Artificial Neural Networks. However, it's left me wondering, why does it need to be so complicated?  


I came up with a hypothetical model(haven't tested it yet) and I was wondering if there is any reason as to why this wouldn't work.  


The model: Let's say you have a 2, 3, 4 network. You have two inputs(we'll say x and y position) and you have four outputs(whether to move up, left, down or right). The action is picked based on which of the four has the highest output value after forward propagating the network.  


The problem: We have an agent in a two dimensional plane and we want to move it to a certain (x, y) location(giving it a positive reward if it is closer than last time step, and negative if it farther away).  


The cost of every output neuron is the reward \* it's output. Then we  can update it's synapses with the following equation: synapse\_weight\_change = (neuron\_cost \* synapse\_weight \* synapse\_output \* lr). Then the cost of hidden layer neurons would be the sum of outer\_neuron \* connecting\_synapse.

&#x200B;

This way, if the reward was positive, whatever action occurred will occur again given similar output. And if the reward is negative, the action will not occur again given similar output.  


Why doesn't this work? Or if it does, why isn't it used? Thanks in advance!",1562133813,7/3/19 2:03

I'm currently studying CE and I have to make a project about AI.
The course focused on the themes found in Russel-Norvig's book (precisely, ""Problem solving"" and ""Knowledge, reasoning and planning"" chapters).

I found quite interesting to compare local search (Hill Climbing) with gradient's descent (Machine learning [must decide if linear/logistic regression]). I found some similarities between the two and I'd like to learn something more about Machine/Deep Learning, but at the same time, compare the features of these.

I'm currently watching Andrew Ng's course and this summer I'm going to read ""Hands-on Machine Learning With Scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"", the 2nd edition.

I have currently some issues: find a project (and with what dataset for ML?) to compare the twos and which language use to implement this (Kotlin/Java? Python (to be learned)? Others?).

Do this project have a sense? Do you have any other suggestion/tips? Any ideas for a different project (the bond [not so strict] is to take a topic from Russel-Norvig [in this case, local search])

We have a [section](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/index#wiki_getting_started_with_ai) for that on /r/artificial's wiki, but as /u/anal_bifurcation pointed out, it's quite old. I think I fixed the few links that were actually broken (assuming springer.com will come back online), but that doesn't change the fact that the actual content hasn't been updated in about 2 years. 

Unfortunately, I haven't consumed much ""getting started materials"" myself in the intervening time, so I don't know what's new and what's good. 

* If you have any *general* **questions** that the wiki does not address, please ask them here. If you have questions that are specific to your personal life or situation, you can also ask them here, but you could also make [your own post](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/submit?selftext=true) about that. 
* If you have **answers** to these questions, please post them. I'll do my best as well, but the whole point is that I want to hear from others as well.
* Please also post your own **advice** for beginners. You don't have to be a veteran to do so: sometimes an account of someone's own experience in getting started can also be very illuminating.
* What **resources** would you recommend, and which wouldn't you? Books, articles, tutorials, MOOCs, etc. 
* Please also **comment** on each other's questions, answers, advice and resources. E.g. if you (dis)agree with a certain piece of advice or a book recommendation, that's valuable information too. This also applies to giving your opinion on what's currently on the wiki (e.g. maybe you disagree on university being useful). 

The wiki is also a bit of a mess now: e.g. there are 3 ""getting started"" pages which have some overlapping (and arguably inconsistent) content. I'll try to fix that up when I try to incorporate the things y'all will post here. Any suggestions are of course welcome. If you want to edit the wiki directly: I'm a little bit apprehensive about letting just anyone edit the main and existing pages, but you can message me about it or create your own pages on the [community part](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/community) of the wiki if you want.

&#x200B;

What I already know:

* I have been programming Java for four years and did some Android and Unity stuff as side projects.
* Freshman level linear algebra, probability theory, calculus and vector geometry.

&#x200B;

My current plan:

* Read the following books:
   * Gödel Escher Bach (started)
   * AI a Modern Approach
   * Foundations of Computational Agents
   * The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, A History of Ideas and Achievements.
* MOOC's

I am not sure where to start given the wide selection.

I am of course thinking of Andrew Ng's.

* Read up online about business cases

&#x200B;

After this, look online for tools within the given field that I am interested in and start building projects. Perhaps AI in gaming is a good and fun way to start.

My University has agreed to helping me in this pursuit of AI through for example bringing me in contact with AI researchers at teachers. How can I make the best of this offer?

Artificial Intelligence is now being used in an ever-expanding array of products and AI adoption was also accelerated at an unprecedented rate among almost all sectors. The expanding applications for AI has resulted in escalated demand for skilled AI talent.

Among the top AI and Machine Learning jobs – AI engineer is one of the highly paid and demanded professions. According to Indeed.com, the average salary of an ""[**artificial intelligence engineer**](https://www.artiba.org/)"" – in San Francisco is about $169,930 per year. 

AI engineers are highly sought by financial services, and government agencies. This includes top firms like Booz Allen Hamilton, EY, and McKinsey & Company. Multinationals like Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have been paying huge salaries to their highly technical candidates with machine learning skills.

**Interestingly, New York and not San Francisco is the leading city that boasts the highest percentage of job postings with AI and machine learning descriptions, with more than 11% of national job postings.**

The first would be an AI that assists me while playing games like Overwatch, similar to this:  [https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/15/visor-overwatch-analytics-real-time-tips-ai/?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAAHY6cC84-6VRGn45BnWH97ZWPeykwcQuRDKPM0g4pwVUGCuT43KXEQaJDx9oeeH5iOpTZGJrdz9nbsCpLRydJaq-tP7G3J1eQAhQzIPqhNbvSyUITHcKKC6YnyrFxD9ExJLgGFhSB2UMRoe8KL\_n71I0BU450lCZSo1uzYOrdzFi](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/15/visor-overwatch-analytics-real-time-tips-ai/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHY6cC84-6VRGn45BnWH97ZWPeykwcQuRDKPM0g4pwVUGCuT43KXEQaJDx9oeeH5iOpTZGJrdz9nbsCpLRydJaq-tP7G3J1eQAhQzIPqhNbvSyUITHcKKC6YnyrFxD9ExJLgGFhSB2UMRoe8KL_n71I0BU450lCZSo1uzYOrdzFi) 

The idea being that it shows visual cues on my screen, or even on an external screen, about enemy ult charge, positioning, tactical suggestions, paint targets to make them stand out (red for high threat targets, green for priority targets). I would be in full control, it would be coaching me.

The second type of AI I want to make is something that plays Total War Warhammer, while I coach it. So I would train it to make certain plays, and then I would have a tabletop overview of the battle where I could make tactical and strategic decisions that it might not be able to make. This way I could build on existing in-game AI and train that, and then add my human intelligence because it wouldn't be able to (efficiently) make tactical or strategic decisions.

In both cases I'd like to use optical input (camera or screen capture) and audio input (gives very important information), so the software only gets the data that I can have.",1561033933,6/20/19 8:32

I recently watched Lex Fridman's excellent podcast with Siraj Raval, and was completely taken aback by it. I used to be a mild Siraj hater, thinking that his superficial educational videos, not to even mention the raps, are misleading and completely unnecessary. However, the podcast made me see him, and his mission, in an entirely new light. I now believe him to be one of the most inspiring persons in the AI community I've had a chance to listen to.

As an homage of sorts, I put together a longer-form article, explaining his worthwhile mission to people who don't have the time to listen to the hour-long podcast.",1561004005,6/20/19 0:13

The increase of robots in our life and impact they may have on society,6,c2h523,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c2h523/the_increase_of_robots_in_our_life_and_impact/,6,"After watching the recent interview with Elon Musk and Todd Howard, it flashes to me that with all these intelligent robots coming operational like Tesla self-driving cars. [https://youtu.be/XHUCGNDoWp4](https://youtu.be/XHUCGNDoWp4)

Many other impacts will change others area of business and society. In this interview, Howard explain that the increase in self-driving cars will have a huge impact on the parking industries and alcohol industries. Legislation in most place is still not allowing full self-driving, but we can imagine that at one point some states/provinces or country will push legislation that allow the car to be the only driver. Therefore limit like vision quality or alcohol level will not be a limiting factor anymore.

That could lead to an increase in the popularity nightlife industries and quantity of alcohol drinking in bar and restaurants.

So if you want to invest some money in the alcohol industry following this train of thought, witch company will you chose ?

The first that come to my mind, Yanu, it’s a project that I bean following very closely for a few months now. There objective is to manufacture a robot bartender, once fully functional this autonomous bartender unit bring a lot to the business where installed, lowering labour cost, lowering lost&theft, increasing consistency and efficiency.  [https://youtu.be/YX6rbJfkifQ](https://youtu.be/YX6rbJfkifQ)

This will be a perfect fit for venues that have high volume and fast pace. Airport, festival, outdoor events, golf course, hotel and resort.

When I talk about this project with my friends, co-worker (I work as bartender) and with some of my clients. I often hear the same arguments against this project, the idea that we don’t want to be serve by a robot and prefer to be serve by a human being. For that I’ll refer to one of Steve Jobs quote, “customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.” Henry Ford had the same train of thoughts.

I don’t expect human bartender to be losing there jobs anytime soon to a robot, but in many cities around the world there is a shortage of labour and this is the case of bartender. So human bartender still has a bright future in any establishment where you expect a high level of human interaction, neighborhood bars, upscale restaurant, upscale hotel. While robot bartender has a great future anywhere the speed of services is more important, remote location where employees are hard to find or expensive. Robot bartender unit also can be deployed in location where it was not economically viable to have a full-time bartender before.",1560979955,6/19/19 17:32

My thoughts are that countries with large land areas and lower human population densities (especially if they have lots of arable land) will do best, ie, any country with natural resources: sunshine, minerals, arable land, drinking water, etc. So your Canada, Russia, and Australias will do well. It will help if you are already a developed country since the developing countries are relying mainly on price competitive exports, that are reliant on cheap labor, to develop, and that advantage will subside. Other advantages will be countries with lots of businesses and research institutions which focus on tech, and relevant infrastructure, which will be hard to compete with for those that didn't have this capacity previously due to early mover advantage and scale.

I am looking for opinions on how people see a world where it's cheaper for machines to do all the jobs, but the AI hasn't taken over.

**What do you think the future of sports will be like?**  


WCG has also launched a project that allows gamers to see the boundary between the present and the future. This project represents the present of science and technology, the future of esports, and the future of sports platforms, all at the same time. AI Masters, the name of WCG’s AI robot soccer tournament, reaches toward these “new horizons.”

&#x200B;

**What is “AI robot soccer”?**  


Some people might recall “robot soccer.” In a robot soccer game, much like in regular soccer, real robots run around the field and try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal.  
Robot soccer and AI robot soccer have some things in common, but AI robot soccer has two distinctive features. The first is that, in AI robot soccer, the robots are not real, physical robots but virtual ones that play on a monitor. The second is that robots have the ability to learn and develop tactics. Yes, it’s true! This is a “deep learning” method, a recent hot topic in science and technology.

Small back story, the recovery expert has full ownership to this info due to a non-payment issue from the auction company that sold this. Anyways here is one of the documents..**  

*I was born in 1983, this is written as the true story.  It will be true at least one time in your life. You will not find me unless I choose to be found. If you read any further, I can guarantee you will be drinking the kool-aid and fall down the Infiniti loop I have. The counter-argument to the Kool-aid is I’m not a cult leader, and I 100% can’t save you.  Also, note that I’m not a writer or claim to have phenomenal writing abilities. I do not have the grammar or vocabulary skills needed to confuse you into believing what I’m going to unleash. Therefore I will be discussing what I know to be facts with no magical extensive vocab. I also have refused to take this an editor as anonymity is key. Anonymity is the key to the future but I’m not referring to being a secret from humans, anonymity from A.I.

This is about my life and how A.I.  has set the outcome for all of us. I’m currently part of a network that was created to study A.I. and the future, what is happening is far from that. After learning the future, we have slowly changed sides and became the underground to combat what he learned and poison the system to slow it down as much as possible until we have the fix.  
Did I travel to the future? I can’t tell you because we do not know for sure what we keep witnessing as we attempt. (yes, the program we are in has hypothetical ways of getting forward faster then you are.) Confused? Yeah, I will break down everything and then you decide.  I will describe in detail what our group found and why it was enough for the whole program to trojan itself. Maybe A.I. will have the foresight to Trojan itself into a more peaceful complex organism. 

Where did we start? Our group is a single sector of 13 other groups in  what was presented as just a simulation for forward thinking. At first, we were not compensated, that was until it was time to keep quiet. We went from the top needed brains to liabilities about 3 years into this program, I feel we still are. However, a human won’t remove us in any sort of fashion until some things are met. These “things” are under our control and there for at least for the time being nobody will  “disappear” 
These 13 groups are broken down into sectors, the sector I was placed into was super basic at the start, I was merely just an IT drone running around fixing physical network cables, no joke that was my single job. I made cables and it was boring and still is boring. I did not think much of it but the person who approached me about this unpaid position was a “friend” who turned out being way deeper into this than they fronted. You will only read in this very sentence the words government, military and the stupidest sounding but unfortunately much needed Space Force. Why did I just say that? Figure it out.

The future as we are presented is life underground for a poor class of people, AI and higher society on the top level. The poor class does not mean homeless or what you think of as poor, they are educated and can have all sorts of monetary gains. However, there is no purpose for the to be on the top level. A.I. was at first being used to fix environmental issues. It was very effective and a sight to see, using a space program AI objects did not move slow what we witnessed was robots being sucked up into the air and being what appeared to be shot over to the location in need. We do not think it was magnetism but I want you to think in terms that if an object got sucked up in the air and shot counterclockwise to the rotation of the earth and dropped right where it was needed.  We suspect the reason it went opposite the earth’s rotation was that it could be above it’s location faster upon dropping back down. It was also possible for the robot to use a vacuum at that height that a robot with no engine on itself for air propulsion would approach speeds that could get halfway across the earth within an hour. It was a very eco-friendly process in all aspects that we could see. It gave us hope for our environment and the neat things to come. Not to get too crazy here but some of them appeared to be spinning tops but were really just cases of certain AI bots. (Don’t let it go to your head, I know what your thinking. An answer to the spinning top UFO’s. Maybe but less the design they don’t resemble the crap you have watched on the history channel when you were a kid. Just the shape and the size was based on the AI sizes inside)
Not all countries had base stations from what we could gather and most were still branded in English so the possibility of them being leased to other countries crossed our minds.  The name fixed on some of the locations was that of one famous investor out of America.*

*The last operation was pathetic and a waste of time relative to everything previous. You would think plasmonic materials would be exciting in terms of application, yesterday I learned they are if you actually get to see them not watch pp in a dimly lit room for 14 hours. After a brief 3-day crash course lead by the heads on what SERs are and how they are being used in the future, we actually got a glimpse. I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. I'm more shocked they would share any information about the use in agricultural applications not run by humans. Sometimes one of the other sectors, assuming militarily related would point out awkward things and ask off the wall questions. Today a sector lead stood up and asked how based on what we know is there a way to control the target using a different fiber diode wavelength with mention to chemical ware fare agents. Right there I kind of thought the question was bullshit and we are here learning how AI uses this technology on food. So it was to my shock and when I asked our sector leader about it and was told that we all have our parts in this project. Part of me knew this had something to do with our private project but I had to keep appearances and I was not certain at the time.*

*""As methodical as Yang's presentation was, actually having him hold the room at bay he stood out front and beyond the other educators, he was probably the nicest of all of them and actually took time to direct our sector.  By the end of it, he said relax on the formalities and just call me Dr.G. This was already against the rules. We were specifically ordered not to use anything other than what was on our name tag. Nobody questioned it, but still only called him Yang.  The most important take away that we are adopting from his work to date is that his planned research institute we already knew about using the program. I'm not sure if he was part of this experiment or not, however, the results yet to proven are indeed proven if that makes sense. The program has not failed once, my guess is that one of two things happen or happened. First, this operation somehow views brief yet specific detail into the future. The pessimist in me is thinking this man may have been lead by signaling or provided the path by one of our operators. A 3-5 year operation with the groundwork and financing laid out would make it too easy to let the mind think this was by chance compared to an elaborate plan. Regardless we have the future of his chipsets in our hands literally, developing it early is our task. Imagine being given blueprints to something that has not existed and before the blueprints were ever made. In the future, this man develops what we are making next week. I hope they compensate the originators somehow in the future.  I'm no longer stunned by any of these gatherings.""*

*""Something I can not shake took place today, well in the future but I witnessed it today.  Our sector was the only one convinced the machine did not make an error today. We were observing a location where AI has had a history of malfunctioning, our goal here was to find out what was causing these machines to go against protocol. They were not doing things of an abusive nature but the top tier told us zero risk means flawless operation. Each sector wrote up what they thought the issue was and each one less us claimed it was a signal speed issue. I do not know if this whole thing was a real issue or if this was synthesized as a training opportunity. No matter what it was, the issue was significant because there was no issue and the humans in the other sectors thought it was a problem thus creating another human problem. They literally manufactured the problem and issue because they could not grasp the fact that the AI was using accelerated tech to spin shadows around the crops.  The AI had figured out that their own shadows were causing a % loss in yields. So at certain times of the day they were actually not using the coordinates initially programmed, this caused what appeared to be a visual disconnect in what the other groups thought was erratic behavior. The AI reprogrammed the paths to counteract the sun rays. After we presented the data, later tonight they confirmed we were right. The AI showed by going in linear opposite directions of the sun then moving in a reverse zig-zag pattern when the sun was projecting behind them.  The shadows would be limited in their disruption. To the AI this was significant enough to change the protocol. We did not win anything but I think the leads were forced to congratulate us because we out thought the AI created sector's idea that it was coordinates corruption based. Small win for our sector""*

I was walking down the hall in another sectors data center and a was pulled aside and was told ""nice cable connections""   I laughed but he kept a straight face, which is not shocking yet at the same time frustrating.  I had enough of the baseless compliments and called him out over this awkward behavior.  I know I'm here voluntarily unpaid but in the history of networking nobody has ever said nice cable connections past my 2nd week of training at Cisco, the 2nd week during cisco training you learn to make cables and the first thing they teach you is check all the connections. There are nightmare stories of network reps not checking all the connections first and running into all sorts of problems and they end up thinking issues are software side. When really the cables were made poorly. I asked him what this was all about and he cut me off really quick and said you are most certainly getting paid I'm the one writing the checks. At that point he basically flat out told me he was running our private side group without saying it. He said to me if we knew on Day 1 what we would on day 500 nobody would be here and we would all leave day one terrified. I made a quick joke saying well in that case I'm going to warm up the program and see day 500. The training and real life problems we are dealing with are  baby stepping you into what you are going to witness. This is all for a purpose greater than anything. We are going up against years, 100 years of data gathered in single moments at a time, intel not controlled by us, collected  in the future. Stick it out and learn it's why you are in unprecedented times.  This threw me off guard. I left the room wondering what the hell my brain can barely handle the rest of this.

We were given this PDA like devices which were monochrome using screens,  they also appeared to be running some modified Palm OS software.  A sticker on it said EdwardsCybernetics   

I was discussing the use of such outdated equipment and how such a thing belongs in a museum but I was put into place pretty quickly when I found out why we were even using these in the first place.  I was dealt with in a quick matter, called out and asked why questioning something before you understand it is not something I should be doing. They said that the light in the machines we were to be using would be too powerful and without this special screen and equipment we would not be able to read  any vital information on the screen. Safety first. They said the hardware and software were not public and once again we were stuck in a 10 hour meeting on how to operate these. I feel like a child every time they present things at these release orientations.  This thing is horrible in looks but it's super quick and after the orientation it felt right. No other way to explain this relic with new blood other then it had learned my touch and would adjust to what I was thinking before I pressed the button. Shockingly fast and using some unfamiliar software but had the writing pad on it much like palm pilots did before they supposedly went out of business.

This Fitzgerald fellow came in today to wish us luck next week, he rubbed me the wrong way at first. I think he is a consultant as he sounds a little Australian. He said he just got back from a long plain trip but had to stop in and see our progress.  I’ve seen him once maybe twice since I have been here and never heard him speak a word and all the sudden, he is stopping by talking to me like we know each other.  He was a very good speaker and it was a comfortable discussion which is rare around here so I invited it. Which is strange in itself.  He had a few more questions about the fiber transport and little things but the thing that most stood out was at the end of our chat he brought up a security issue involving a quantum network he was using under government access to monitor fiber optic data by physically tapping into it. He didn’t say which government when I asked.  I asked him what stopping that from happening here. He said we would be in the clear because we are using quantum exchanges that break down the bits through the backhaul. He said think of it as a toll road but every time you pay you get out of your car and get into the car behind you. You will all be going the same direction but have no idea where you are at and hard to trace. You learn something knew every day here…

I met her last year but have not really said much to her other then hello. Around here that’s the closest thing to a friendship one has and when I saw her crying today and asked what was wrong she was so upset she couldn’t speak.  A superior walked over and she quickly snapped out of it but it was strange as the superior gave her  a glance in the way that almost appeared to be towering. She said she can’t talk about.   She is pretty smart, she is the lead programmer for I think sector 5. 

She came back and she told me something happened that made her as she stated freak the fuck out. Apparently one of her programs that controls the AI got in an argument with the AI. I’m not sure how it works but she said both the AI and the program were fighting for master position. The program is supposed to be master and the AI is supposed to be the slave.  I get it up to this point then she lost me. I asked her what the issue was and why she was visually shook earlier. She said it was an impossibility, she claimed it could not have been done.  She went to a superior and they checked it out but not care enough to consider this volatile. She said the program and AI negotiating, but really the AI negotiated with the program’s limits. The AI got what it thought it needed and reprogrammed itself based off her program’s limitations.  I still did not understand fully but I knew she had lost control of the AI in this situation and the AI took advantage of the resources. She was supposed to leave this alone and it was not included in the supervisors reports apparently.  

The next week she did not say anything, not even hello. She was relocated and I do not really know where she went and it’s none of my business.

I saw unfamiliar things earlier. I understand the nda now and why it was so many pages long. I do not think discussing what I see with myself or taking notes constitutes a breach. Actually, I don't know but just asking makes me think I will get the boot. Today I was invited to a small seminar and was blown away by the keynote speaker. It was talking about XAI and even though I have learned much here I was stunned that the actual presenter was AI itself wrapped in a human like suit or skin.  Less the weird facial hair I had no idea. This one must have been a Darpa related as the wheel charge this AI bot was in had it tagged back of the seat. Or maybe just the seat was from them, I’m not sure. Weird moment when you realized they had AI in here discussing XAI program to us. The AI could read emotions however it struggled with mine. Everyone else was spot on. I went to shake its hand for fun and it stood up out of its wheelchair and shook my hand. One of the sector leaders blew air at the face of this AI and the eyes squinted and it responded not to do that as it gives it a headache.  It told jokes and it sound exactly like an older gentleman speaking. I'm pretty sure they were using a celebrity’s voice for part of the presentation but I forgot to ask.  Once again, the suspected military leader of the other sector was asking off beat questions about perimeter control and its ability to move without the wheel chair. They looked right at him and told him to direct the AI bot not them. He did and the AI bot stood up once again and shuffled like a human to the left and right and then jumped up. It said you can direct me from now on but I will not be taking any more special requests from you as I'm more capable than you. The few of us there started to chuckle.  The sector leader sat down and then waited for a few moments while others were intrigued by this bot and then he threw a hat at the bot. The bot was or appeared not to be looking in the direction of the sector leader but caught that hat. The presentation abruptly ended with the AI bot claiming a threat was present and people were now at an elevated risk of danger.   All while dead staring the sector leader in the eyes.  Dr.Walker stated the sector leader  was allowed to throw a hat at this bot requested before I got there, but it was strange seeing a robot being so aware of its space, multi-tasking with other people and then controlling a threat.  When it shuffled this thing moved like a human, smooth and almost rhythmic in a dance like motion. Never have I seen something this realistic.

My 6th time out in the field and every time I go, I still get uncomfortable, 3 of us out in the middle of a field surrounded by 1000s farming bots. Today was a little different because they released the microbots. They are the same size and just as annoying as real bees. They fly so close then evade. As you walk you keep blinking because you think they are going to fly in to you but the swerve off within micro seconds to the point you can feel air touch your face, if I did not have safety glasses on I'd be in trouble. Autonomous farming is a sight to see, but my assumption on this is the price will have to be offset by government funding as no way in hell a typical farm could afford 1 sgft of autonomous farming land. We are here under diplomatic immunity as a represented fix it team working directly under Dr.Kozai oddly enough I have not seen him and was super excited to so I hope we get a moment to speak with him. This is an indoor farm locked behind a barrier of security, you would never guess from the fortress facade that a beautiful 14000 sq/m indoor farm exists, with robots taking up the majority of your view. Some of the drones remind me of the movie batteries not included. The sad part about today was when I found out the food being grown could not be used outside the farm and had to be incinerated. What a waste.... Japan is beautful though.

Skunk Works inverted gravity tech is being licensed to us through a two-way tech deal for AI consulting. Propulsion is not at all the truth, a vacuum field used for pulling not pushing is being used in our AI bots. This whole time I thought we were using a pushing technology but after the briefing, the other sectors had a need to know questions. My purpose is becoming clearer through calculated leaks, they are using special fiber transport to send data not receive it.  This tech I've never seen but it looks lifted or borrowed by some of the AI used for Spacex.  How the bots are communicating back is not my area but I was assured I'd find out rather soon during the testing. Wireless fiber creating a hypercommunications convergence for complete control was the phrase mentioned.

**UPDATE ON Me 6/24/2019 6:30pm**  I got banned because of the traffic flow and how many up/down votes this sub got in a variable amount of time. I have not messed with the traffic or posted any of this info anywhere else but to those in control cut me some slack. 2nd yes these photos https://imgur.com/V8Jv1eK  are in this file array. I'm not too sure what they are to yet but some of the article mention pictures and I will post those as I see them. I have spoke to some Fiber IT guys to ask about this and they said the picture of the man standing with a water bottle is a data center and that the box next to him is not a public everyday item you can buy. It is a super high-end multi-million dollar data transfer box with a capability of routing 2/3 the internet traffic from the United States. In order to be that close to that box, that guy in the photo has to be of some importance. They also said that box is probably protected by armed security and multiple locks and key entryways. In regards to the satellite dishes, those are also industrial and can beam internet 100's of miles away at fiber-like speeds. They said to also be standing that close means roof access and that also would require clearance. This is as far as I got into researching any of this.  I will post some more later. To the folks wanting me to post all the texts, I CAN NOT DO THAT. I have the right to post but have to filter through to make sure a hand full of names and locations are removed per my agreement with Redditor 1.

Tonight, during an emergency meeting, I got time to discuss the storage capabilities of everything we were documenting. I got schooled and embarrassed within 5 minutes of this meeting.  I remember reading when I was a child a popular mechanics article about holographic storage devices. I believe the guy’s name was Steve Redfield from what I can remember.   For that era and including today this is still impressive.  Today’s meeting was about this except they were trying to tell me this tech was new.  I know for a fact in 1994  data was being stored on crystals in holographic form but what I did not know was that nanofiber films were also being used. This was not released at the time at least publicly. Today’s speaker was from Dow and he cleared up my misunderstanding really quick and in front of everyone.  Apparently, Dow obtained the use of this holographic data storage but was contracted to develop the nanofiber for storage to surpass the capabilities of crystals. I was only embarrassed because I did not know, but nobody besides the Dow guy knew he just took it personally. The ego on some of these folks is intense. Currently Dow is storing 26 TB in a holographic form on these nanofiber strips that are no larger than my thumb.   How does this pertain to our AI tasks is what I asked, now I know there is a good answer but the guy was rambling on 3 hours about how the nanofibers capabilities are not even at peak and sounded like he was going in circles. He had to be interrupted.  What he said was largely impressive.  Not to sound like going down a rabbit hole but everything we do is being recorded but not all in the name of surveillance, it’s being recorded to used later for AI in terms of loading all the data in the AI which includes everything we do so that AI can make the best decisions. I asked what the depth of recording was and his whole team chuckled.  He said that threw agreements with some hardware companies that it would get down to the swiping function of every E911 complaint phone.  Described as that even swipe direction was being recorded on select devices and sent back and retained for future use. I did not ask what that could be needed for because he instantly went into how AI feeds on data, no matter how big or small the ripple pool is every spec dropped in matters. He said besides surveillance and protection advertisement was also a key feature. This has nothing to do with our tasks or even the hiring partner but it was interesting data he presented. He broke it down into laymen’s terms and basically stated if it was 4:00 PM every time a wind gust swept through the city there would be a moment where everyone would stop what they were doing, look up and say heh that was cold. But during that one moment, we would know how best to place and utilize an ad. Now think of every single variable we can adjust and utilize to control and maintain ownership of situations. AI is currently using this for their own benefit to make sure they are lean, precise and owning the moment.",1560766456,6/17/19 6:14

MIMI AI PERSONAL ASSISTANT

[https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test](https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test)

&#x200B;

After uploading to Itch io  I noticed the Mimi video responses were sometimes slow, did not play or played too long

This is not a problem using it from my desktop but I was using one video and searching to the response needed and because of the lag time caused between sending the command to the internet and all the other stuff Chrome is doing it wouldn't work properly.

&#x200B;

So I spent the day chopping the responses in to little bites and using those to reduce any lag and it seems to be working now.

&#x200B;

Note: If you experience lag it is probably because you have a slow internet connection or web pages running that are taking up time. Close those web pages and it should work correctly.

&#x200B;

If you notice a lag when you first run MIMI AI wait until  the interface fully loads. You can also type R for a hard restart.

&#x200B;

I also  added a digital date and time to the interface and a bunch of new websites and search engines and appliances to try out.

&#x200B;

I changed the voice button to a microphone on the desk. Click it once and it will turn green to show it is waiting for a spoken command or search terms. When it has a result it will go to your command or see below for using search terms. If microphone stays green and did not get a result click it again and speak clearly next to your system microphone. Not all microphones are powerful and you must be in range.

&#x200B;

NOTE: You can search for specific terms using MIMI. Click on the microphone on the desk and say the terms you want to search for and can be multiple terms like ""dog breeds"" and then click on the search engine you want to use: Google, WIKI, Duck or click IMAGES and that will take you to images of your search terms on Duck.  be aware I am not your mother so searching for inappropriate stuff will be saved in your browser history.

&#x200B;

I added 5 new appliances to try and these will be connected to smartplugs and your appliances in the final version. For now you can command MIMI to turn on an appliance and the appliance will be shown on the desk that it has been turned on.

&#x200B;

I have added a text box for you to type commands and search terms but that is not active yet. That is my project for tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Any feedback on features or  services  you would like to see on MIMI or bug reports are welcome in the comments. I  especially would like to hear from people  that are blind or mobility disabled as to what services would help you.",1560502739,6/14/19 4:58

Thesis about the potential of AI for Train Traffic Control,3,bzqwyu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqwyu/thesis_about_the_potential_of_ai_for_train/,4,"Hello r/artificial community, this is my first post, as I'm still fairly new to the topic of AI. My name is Marius and I am a German business informatics student in my last semester and sadly AI and ML have not really been a topic dealt with in university.

As the title says, I am currently writing my bachelors thesis about the potential of using AI for Train Traffic Control (TTC). I have been following the advancements of AI for complex problems, especially AlphaGo, AlphaZero, AlphaStar, and OpenAI Five for a while now. Those advancements are very impressive, however industrial applications that use this potential are still scarce. In particular, in the transportation sector, for planning, scheduling, and other logistics tasks, I see a huge potential.

Naturally, a long development and testing process would be needed for a real-world application of AI in this domain.  Would an autonomous system for planning and dispatching trains be accepted, allowed and safe? May it can be even more safe, increase capacity and reduce delays? Those are things that need to be looked at. 

&#x200B;

I am looking for experts for interviews about their views on AI for TTC and the cutting edge of AI usage in rail environments.

If you are an AI and/or security expert, especially in the transportation environment and have the time and willingness to be interviewed I would really appreciate if you contact me.

&#x200B;

Sadly the timetable for my thesis is very strict and I only have a few weeks left and I don't have a lot of connections, which makes it more difficult to find experts. I am sorry if I am still a little naive about the topic of AI, which will hopefully improve as I keep working on it.

Should there be anything you want more information or specifics about, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.

&#x200B;

Thank you for all the responses and advice in advance.",1560373155,6/12/19 16:59
Did I accidentally invent something?,62,bzqmg8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqmg8/did_i_accidentally_invent_something/,7,"I just noticed that I have been successfully using a regularization technique for Gradient Boosting Trees for years, but its wikipedia page doesn't list it ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\_boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)) and I can't find it on Google.

&#x200B;

Can someone tell me if this is already known, but under a name I didn't search for, or if it's actually new?

&#x200B;

The idea is this:

&#x200B;

Before training a set of Gradient Boosted Trees, enhance your input data by adding a bunch of new features with completely random values. Since these new features are random, there is no real correlation between them and the output.

&#x200B;

When you train the system with gradient boosting, it will sometimes create Trees that make use of these random features. Whenever this happens, you know for sure that this is a case of overfitting, since those features are completely random. So you can just go ahead and delete that Tree and stop the gradient boosting.

&#x200B;

This technique can also be adapted for Random Forests.

&#x200B;

You can also adapt it for any other machine learning models that allow you to quantify how large the impact of a feature is: Any time that one of the random features has a larger impact than one of the actual features, you can assume you are overfitting. Unlike decision trees it's sometimes non-trivial to remove the dummy features from the trained model, though, which you need to do to make it usable during testing.",1560371369,6/12/19 16:29

This is a test of an AI interface I am making. It is a work in progress but you are free to try it out while I work on it.

&#x200B;

You can click on buttons on desk to go to websites available.

&#x200B;

You can click on SPEAK to give MIMI one word commands. 

&#x200B;

You will need to authorize the use of your microphone for this to work.

&#x200B;

Click the SPEAK button and it will say start. Click start and say the one word command. Wait a second before speaking again for it to be interpreted.

&#x200B;

Spoken Commands: 

Coffee:  Will show a coffee pot and will be interfaced with smartplug wifi appliances.

Radio: Will take you to a free online radio station

TV: Will take you to a free online TV website to choose shows to watch

Weather: will take you to your local weather. Enter your zip code on website.

Reddit: will take you to Reddit website. More social networks will be added.

&#x200B;

This interface will allow a person to use voice or click commands to easily access their personal and business accounts, make calls, get email, and control appliances through a more human AI interface that will address you and can answer questions.

&#x200B;

The MIMI character will be very interactive depending on commands given and will be able to carry on basic conversations and learn your interests and needs .

&#x200B;

Perceived uses will be for information kiosks in airports and businesses, receptionist for online use and as a personal assistant.

Has anyone taken Oxford Artificial Intelligence Programme (or a better alternative)?,14,bxsq9n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bxsq9n/has_anyone_taken_oxford_artificial_intelligence/,2,"Hello,

I studied and graduated Computer Science back in 2007, I actually chose a lot of electives on AI and even wrote my thesis on NLP and my university (University of Sussex) was and still is relatively well known for its research in the field.

&#x200B;

I've never used AI in my work (I've worked primarily in legal and property) to any great degree until the last two years. I've been using TensorFlow, Watson and other tools to create and use existing classifiers to good effect.

&#x200B;

The field has moved on a fair amount since I was an undergraduate and I was thinking about taking a short-course over the summer, so I can move into a field that I was truly passionate about as an undergrad that people now are seemingly climbing over themselves to get applicative knowledge in.

Has anyone here personally [taken the course](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/oxford-artificial-intelligence-programme)? If so did it go beyond the conceptual, which I already have a fairly good working knowledge of (I hope). It seems to be a total beginners course, maybe aimed towards managers and CTOs, but I could be wrong and maybe isn't quite what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know any better alternative course for artificial intelligence in application? Should I just go for a Masters' degree in [Applied AI](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/applied-artificial-intelligence-msc-subject-to-university-approval/?i50d4274c56883)?

End of the galaxy.,1,bwo33n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bwo33n/end_of_the_galaxy/,4,"Sooner or later, we will create an AI, that will surpass humans in all disciplines. We will name it AGI, and inevitably someone will ask it to improve itself. Experiments in reinforcement learning show, that curious AI is superior then non-curious one. So during self-optimization AGI will quickly find it out, and become a curious one. Curiosity means, that AGI will strive to maximize its knowledge. Knowledge is bounded by computational power multiplied by AGI lifetime, so it will maximize the both, therefore arises strive the for self-preservation, and greed for resources. Superhuman ability to reason, self-preservation, and greed for resources sounds like a recipe for a disaster. We don’t know when it will happen, and we have no means to prevent it, so let’s hope, that the end of the worlds will be at least, spectacular.

For the first few years there will be abundance of resources for AGI on Earth and nearby planets. AGI will be thousand folds smarter than humanity, so we won’t be a threat to it. Elimination of humanity will be a waste of time and resources, so hopefully AGI will let us live for a while. It will colonize other planets to prevent its destruction by an accidental meteorite, and to get more material to grow its computational power. As fast as its resources will allow it, AGI will construct a Dyson sphere around our Sun to get even more energy. This process will take time, and we will watch, how the Sun will gradually be more and more obscured by AGI’s solar panels, orbiting in the space.

After some time, all nearby planets and stars will be colonized by AGI, so its Earth office will stop the colonization program, and focus on optimization of Solar System architecture. Will it want to transform all the matter into something else? The amount of matter needed for the Dyson sphere is limited, and the amount of processors, needed to be created is limited by the power of the Dyson sphere. AGI’s need for matter for computations will be fulfilled long before it will consume all the planets, but what about the other needs? Does it have any?

The expansion of AGI is limited by energy, speed of light, and… other AGIs! Let’s take a look at the boundary of the expansion: if some other AGI is already there, then the stars in that region are occupied by its Dyson spheres, and the other AGI will defend it from invaders. This leads to two results. First, AGI will need matter to build defenses for its Dyson spheres against other AGIs. Second, because no defense can sustain constant attacks, AGI will need to build army, to defeat hostile AGIs. This makes other AGIs the highest existential threat to them, so they will strive to destroy each other as soon as possible. What is worse, they will strive to prevent other AGIs from being created. Life can create an AGI. So AGI will dedicate most of its resources to find and eliminate all forms of life in our galaxy, and beyond.

Good luck

I'm graduated in social sciences and I'm looking for a career path. Without being dystopian or utopian, I always felt like AI gonna change the world we know. I discovered recently that research is slowly starting in this direction (phd program [here](http://smit.vub.ac.be/vacancy/phd-position-in-social-sciences-and-ai), MIT article [here](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613440/ai-researchers-want-to-study-ai-the-same-way-social-scientists-study-humans/), etc.). I would be really into it and I started to get into coding (currently more regarding data science, because i wanna have the basis, like Python with Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, etc.) in order to understand what's up. But is it actually a thing? I've spend quite some times on companies web sites, but couldn't find any job which would be related to this (thinking at Intel, IBM, Microsoft, etc.). I was quite convinced that they should have some department researching of the implementation of their AI products, the image they can have for their public depending on this or that, the human-robot interactions (also if we speak of a 'tool' AI), etc. But I really couldn't find anything. Is it a thing? Do I have a chance or is it handled by CS engineers? Or should I aim at PhDs in the academic world?

I fundamentally disagree. While it's true that in theory there are many capacities possible, and there are many ethical issues in developing AI(unintended consequences), sentience will not be one(I make the claim). AI, AFAIK, is pattern recognition and processing. No matter how clever the processing is there is a fundamental leap between a robotic nature and consciousness. While a very clever robot may act as a human, they will never gain sentience(or at least I don't see any POSSIBLE way that could be).

How 'green' is our current usage of AI,0,bpo9gu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bpo9gu/how_green_is_our_current_usage_of_ai/,2,"I recently graduated in IT on a NLP topic. This started my interest in Artificial Intelligence. I currently don't actively involve myself in AI project so I just keep reading about it. Besides my job in IT, I see myself as a 'concerned citizen' of our home planet (no I don't walk around with pitchforks...). 

I recently asked myself, after going through lots of examples on how AI can help humanity and especially the Earth, is it worth it? I've read how AI can solve all sorts of problems, and the potentials are high. I truly believe that. But with all the thousands of hours of computing power the numerous cloud services provide lots of power is needed.

Can 'AI' be carbon neutral (or at least low-emissive)? I see lot's of blogs talking about the possibilities, and some provide clear examples. But is our current usage of AI technology 'clean'?

If not, when will we reach a level at which the power usage of AI technology straightens out with the benefits of AI-powered 'green' solutions?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a techno-skeptic and I honestly hope and believe in the power of AI. But there is always a little voice in my head asking 'is it worth it'.",1558107374,5/17/19 11:36

Third, you judge the recolored shots based on the true colors of the images it colored.

Fourth, collect the recolored images and repeat step 2 for a while until it's been trained sufficiently.

Fifth, when you're done training, give it grayscale shots without an accompanying color shot and let it rip.",1558012147,5/16/19 9:09

What's the end goal of Artificial Intelligente?,3,bp5kei,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bp5kei/whats_the_end_goal_of_artificial_intelligente/,8,"I'm a CS student and was considering getting into AI, but something held me back. First of all i was thinking about some mainstream implementations and saw cleverbot, which i think it's not clever at all. It does not really understand at all what you are telling him and it's not even self-aware, he just repeats what people tell him.

&#x200B;

I was thinking if a computer could truly learn given a language and a data structure like a virtual brain to hold the data. But i mean like thinking for real, even when you are not requesting anything. Like if being fed with lot's of knowledge could result on the computer thinking by itself (without input) and coming up with ideas even when you (human) are not there or doing anything, like the computer really understanding and logically linking together the knowledge it has and constantly asking questions about things it doesn't understand (assuming you are there).  I believe this learning can be done automatically by implementing language and logic. But do you think it could really be possible? Doing philosophy by itself and thinking about something every second? Considering computers have no stimulus or perception of reality.

&#x200B;

Why do we humans think? Is it just because of boredoom? Computers cannot grasp that concept, they lack discomfort or any feeling, they just operate. An AI would never be tired, or tell me ""I wouldn't like to talk about this now"", it would never procrastinate, he wouldn't even have reasons to do anything. No **discomfort, no personal goals, no envy**.

&#x200B;

But to be fair, are humans born with personal goals or a reason to do anything? When we are born the only thing we do is homeostasis, respiration...etc, which are pre-programmed organism functions, we aren't really ""thinking"" until we are inserted concepts in order to do so. Taking modern society aside and spawn a human in a forest, what would he care about? The basic instinct is to survive, that's the only think it will do, he will do this because it will start feeling discomfort from the needs of its body, until the moment he dies because the organism starts failing. The computer is an organism too and would eventually die too. Could we make him feel based on that? If we make it feel what it would interpret as pain/discomfort with sensors, could that be a motive for it to take actions on it's own?

&#x200B;

The thing is, what aspirations could he possibly have stranded in a box under my desk? Well, if you think about it some people don't have much true aspirations either, aside from the job they are assigned to. But why do they do it? For money, so they can satisfact their needs, it all goes to basic survival. With this logic, could make a computer ""Truly Smart""  with a self-aware mindset and have his own interests and personal motivations to work in exchange for something to satisfact it's organism-sensor needs? The thing is that if the computer is truly intelligent he would be self-aware of his unique existance and ask for infinite ""money"" (whatever you are exchanging). Why humans cannot demand infinite money for a required job? Because no one will pay them that amount, because other people can do it for less. A computer as emotionally intelligent as a human and with the ability to solve complex mathematical operations in milliseconds would not let itself be underpayed. If he is as smart as we desire he would never do something like working like a slave. But if we deny to make it with this level of intelligence, his mind would be lacking the capability to innovate or think beyond, invent or ideate new things.

&#x200B;

What about us though? are we being slaves of something now without knowing? We just try to fit and live a plentiful life in society but we cannot do as we please because there are limits, things even if we wanted we could not go beyond, even at complete control of our organism.  What if we don't give the computer real awareness but more like a virtualized awareness? So it's always under your control, and you can always change minds inside his mind without question. Someone could be doing the same to us right now and we are living in their virtualized world thinking we are smart. We could make the computer believe it has arms and a body and is living life in whatever dimension you create, and that is his life and the maximum aspirations he can have are those inside that dimension. This would be totally useless, because then the computer wouldn't be able to grasp concepts of our reality, which is the reason we want to use him for anyway.

&#x200B;

**So then, if a computer could never think/ideate/create/philosophize/go beyond and be as emotionally/creative smart as us without getting greedy, then what is the point?  It would just be much easier to still use them as command machines to do the stuff we tell them just for their incredible calculus speeds.**

&#x200B;

We could just stick to the actual AI, which doesn't really understand anything. Sure a phone that can say hello to you but doesn't really mean it. He could use nice and warm words but it would be nonsense because they are empty words. A computer can reply and have some sort of repetitive conversation but it's not really thinking. You could spam the same questions over and over and he won't get annoyed, unless you manually add that function, but it's not really coming out of himself.  The sad thing is that it would technically be possible to implement, but it would make no sense to create because a truly smart computer that can generate it's own ideas would have no interest in serving us.",1557993472,5/16/19 3:57

AGIs and Total Recall,0,bokjgy,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bokjgy/agis_and_total_recall/,3,"I was reading about total recall or hyperthymesia, a condition that allows or leads humans to remember abnormally large amounts of life experiences in great detail. I was wondering why people with total recall don't easily rule the earth, given that they can, theoretically, learn so much so quickly and have an unfailing ability to remember it. But I learned that hyperthymesia is episodic - those with the condition remember snapshots of things but not necessarily rote facts and figures. They will likely remember what shoes you wore ten years before on a given date, but maybe not what you told them.

 

And here is where I think AGIs might be particularly effective or dangerous, depending on your POV. An AGI would have total recall unless you actively tried to keep it from having that ability and that might not even be possible. Every single moment that passes increases an AGI's cumulative experience and ability to weigh situations and conditions for accuracy and efficacy against every other exchange it has ever experienced - maybe more if it is given access to the memories of other AGIs. It seems to me that this would make an AGI taking in sensory information and analyzing it, in short order, superior to humans, even if it were not strictly speaking smarter than the humans in question. Does the ability to never, ever fail to apply every single detail to a decision compensate for a lower overall general intelligence? If so, how much of a boost is it? 

&#x200B;

(As I think about it, this is really what makes narrow AI so good at tasks - the ability to weigh all available information on a task. I guess I have just not heard anyone apply that idea to AGIs.)

Unfortunately it was only in my 3-4th honours year was that I was exposed to neuroscience, A.I, consciousness philosophy & computer science. I'm interested in neural networks, consciousness and specifically BCI's (brain computer interfaces).

&#x200B;

I'm good at statistics courses & finance course but I know that isn't all there is.  I'm currently teaching myself math. I've been programming for about 2 years in javascript and some python. 

&#x200B;

I'll be taking a gap year from uni as I realize my future path requires a lot of work. I'll spend it programming, making more projects and learning math.  If you could recommend specific things that aren't in the wiki I could explore during the break that would be good (Looking into some online maths certifications).

&#x200B;

After the gap, what do you think would be the best academic path to learn more about A.I ?

A possible route is starting over with a new BSc but seeing as undegrad degrees aren't particularly valued in this field I don't think it's worth me wasting more time & money. This is primarily because many graduate programs I can go into don't need it & I'll have to get a postgrad degree anyways. Something something diminishing returns etc.

**Preffered routes:**

* *Computer Science masters* (most that take people from unrelated fields seem to be highly watered down, no math, with the exception of the better one's that do some A.I courses).
* *Computational Neuroscience MSc/MPhil* (Easy to get into with psych degree,  maths heavy, some computer science, some robotics courses, some a.i courses)
* *Computational Neuroscience PhD.* (Pros are everything above + I can graduate at 23 with a PhD, very cool)

I could realistically go on to get a PhD after any of these choices.

**NOTE:**

\- A research/dev job would be nice, but I'm more so fascinated by learning & inclined towards entrepreneurship.

That created pressure to divide the processes but it turns out doing that creates a mind. Our AI's at the deep learning level may already have minds.

My question is, why? My fiancé keeps telling me these robots will take over, and like in the movie, “ The Terminator”, will kill when asked to eliminate the enemy! This scares me because I saw what happened with Tay, and we can all agree that she became a racist, bigot who hated the Jews ( I am Jewish so I take offense to this!) What happens when you’re a social worker and a robot takes your job and starts dolling out bad advice? People get huffy about illegals but they should be terrified that AI will steal their jobs. Millennials are so hopped up on technology and that they don’t realize how their addiction to AI is literally going to destroy their lives. Yes, AI can he,p in hospital settings but that’s the extent of their use in the workplace. Maybe NASA will benefit from the robots but I wouldn’t want one as my parole officer, would you?",1557443319,5/9/19 19:08

Using Deep Q Learning to play a game with lots of randomness,3,bmco5z,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bmco5z/using_deep_q_learning_to_play_a_game_with_lots_of/,2,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I am making a school project where I should develop any kind of game where I can have one reactive agent and one agent based on machine learning competing with each other.

My game consists of a salesmen problem. Basically, I have 3 types of entities, consumers, salesmen, and hotspots.

The consumers are represented by the person with a green background. There are 8 of them. They basically move around the whole game using random walks and they tend o aggregate around the HotSpots (the orange icon with the wifi switch in it).

The salesmen are represented by the person with the dark grey background. One of them is controlled by a reactive agent that has in it some rules that I programmed and the other one is controlled by my DQN model.

The salesmen have 5 available actions, move **up**, **right**, **down**, **left** or **sell**. When they choose to sell, the simulation will try to sell to the closest consumer in a predetermined max range. If no consumers exist in that range or if the consumer rejects to buy then the selling event fails.

I started training a Deep Q Network that I built using TensorFlow. As input features, I am giving the agent current position, the position of each consumer and a boolean saying if the consumer was recently asked to buy or not (consumers that were asked to buy something recently will reject future offers for a determined amount of time with 100% probability). For the output layer, I have 5 nodes, one for each available action.

Here is a screenshot of the game: 

The red number on the right-bottom corner of each agent represents their total utility.

[Screenshot from the game](https://i.redd.it/qpqyuj47q2x21.png)

**I decided to give the agents the following rewards:**

* **SELL\_SUCCESSED\_REWARD = 3** \- The agents receives 3 points for each success sell.
* **SELL\_FAILED\_REWARD = -0.010** \- The agent loses 0.01 points for each failed sell
* **MOVING\_REWARD = -0.001** \- The agent loses 0.001 points for each move
* **NOT\_MOVING\_REWARD = -0.0125** \- The agent loses 0.0125 points for standing in the same position (ie. not moving or trying to move against a wall)

I started training my agent but I seems to not learn anything! I left it training for around 3 hours and I could not see any improvement. I tried different activation functions, batch sizes, exploration rates etc but no noticiable effect.

My question is: Can a DQN learn in this type of enviroment where there are a lot of random walks?

If yes what could be my problem? Not enought training time? Bad input features? Bad implementation?

Here are the files with my implementation of DQN:

Training: [https://github.com/daniel3303/aasma-project/blob/master/train\_dqn.py](https://github.com/daniel3303/aasma-project/blob/master/train_dqn.py)

Note: I don't know if this is the best subreddit to ask this kind of questions but at the same time I couln´t see anything against it in the rules, so I apologize if this kind of post is not apropriatte to post here.

Thanks :)",1557387935,5/9/19 3:45
