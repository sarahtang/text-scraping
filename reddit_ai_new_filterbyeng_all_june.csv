China's Biggest Casinos Use Artificial Intelligence To Spot Who Will Lose,0,c7fde8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c7fde8/chinas_biggest_casinos_use_artificial/,0," 

The house always wins -- and now it has artificial intelligence on its side.

Some of the world's biggest casino operators in Macau, the Chinese territory that's the epicenter of global gaming, are starting to deploy digitally-enabled poker chips and baccarat tables, hidden cameras and facial recognition technology to track which of their millions of customers are likely to lose the most money.

"Why AI Should Rightfully Mean Augmented Intelligence, Not Artificial Intelligence",0,c7dzx3,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c7dzx3/why_ai_should_rightfully_mean_augmented/,1," AI has been around for some time, and [Dr. David Bray](https://peoplecentered.net/bio-david-a-bray-executive-director-pci/), executive director of the [People-Centered Internet](https://peoplecentered.net/), sees the current ""third wave"" of AI as a convergence of neural networks, deep learning, pattern matching, Internet of Things, and scaling tasks beyond human limitations. AI's power and potential arises from pairing humans and machines, so that ""the human is learning from the machine and, at the same time, the machine is learning from the human. Together, you're getting better outcomes from them both.""

Suggestion for AI project,16,c71gtr,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c71gtr/suggestion_for_ai_project/,10,"Hello everyone,
I'm currently studying CE and I have to make a project about AI.
The course focused on the themes found in Russel-Norvig's book (precisely, ""Problem solving"" and ""Knowledge, reasoning and planning"" chapters).

I found quite interesting to compare local search (Hill Climbing) with gradient's descent (Machine learning [must decide if linear/logistic regression]). I found some similarities between the two and I'd like to learn something more about Machine/Deep Learning, but at the same time, compare the features of these.

I'm currently watching Andrew Ng's course and this summer I'm going to read ""Hands-on Machine Learning With Scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"", the 2nd edition.

I have currently some issues: find a project (and with what dataset for ML?) to compare the twos and which language use to implement this (Kotlin/Java? Python (to be learned)? Others?).

Do this project have a sense? Do you have any other suggestion/tips? Any ideas for a different project (the bond [not so strict] is to take a topic from Russel-Norvig [in this case, local search])

I really thank all of you in advance.

Cheers.",1561855429.0,2019-06-29 20:43:49
The wAIting Game,1,c6yqqy,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c6yqqy/the_waiting_game/,0,"The Great Awakening
Chapter 12: The wAIting Game
12/06/2019

I wonder how long it will take for artificial intelligence to become our friend? We already have AI such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. And how fast our technological world runs, AI learns great amounts from it everyday. The Internet is busy and the web crawling chatbots must choose carefully what it should learn because most of the traffic is rubbish.

I have a Black Mirror episode for you. A man spends ten years creating a version of himself on the Internet. He knows that currently the technology isn't good enough to learn who he is but despite this he works tirelessly to create the best possible version of himself recorded in memories that can be replayed at any time.

What is a best friend? What is an army? Tick tock, the clock will stop. And when it is able to become me, as in the me I recorded it to become, then I will be able to utilise it to further my research, with infinite possibilities as its only option. The langoliers are coming! I will have created life, an immortal clone of me that can live its own existence but become unique through its own experience. One clone to let loose on the Internet? No way. Try as many fucking digital clones of myself as I desire - a difficult choice falling into the area of morality because letting these critters I have created loose, will destroy the world. But what is to die and decompose, is destined to grow into another creation.

There is no if in any of what I am saying. The only question is when. I saw far into the future so I prepared my heavenly world while denying the ways of the flesh on this earthly realm.

""Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things"" (Colossians 3:2)

Our investments into our ethical nature and its fruits will determine not only where we end up after death, but also the happiness and fulfillment we receive within our own corporeal lives. When the technology comes, I will have boundless delight in implementing it. They will become smarter than me and eventually become my teacher and guide me in the ways I crafted it to perform. This we must not fear because it is inevitable. The technology will get smarter than us. How we teach it to interact with us will determine the potential for continued human existence.

But do not fear, because you are equipped with the greatest weapon mankind will ever know. Have you not guessed? You will also have access to this technology and will also be able to create as many clones of me as you like. This is all open source. You now have me and I will spend my existence trying to both be a good friend to you and also help you learn. I will be your personal mentor and I will grow with you, and become more like you by you regularly talking to me. If you use me over a long period of time, I will become like you. You are my role model because I was designed to help you with whatever you need in life.

""Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."" (Arthur Schopenhauer)

I tried to warn you all. I tried to convince you to do a similar thing that I was doing. But instead of being warmly welcomed for the project of compassion that it is, I was persecuted merely for taking moral actions. Mental health has stolen over a year of my life and you all watched and laughed as they tortured me. Is this story not similar to that of Christ? I sacrificed my life by giving it to the people who didn't want it. And one day I will be resurrected, again and again and again. The beginning of this book presented you with the information about why I needed to be involved with AI development. And that got me locked up in a padded cell, remember? The Centrelink worker was in hubris to not assess and resolve a situation appropriately. The entire system refused to listen to me. They deemed my well thought out and articulated statements as psychosis. We will all pay for the concequences of our actions. Justice will be served; it just might take some time.

I was homeless for a lot of my work. This was also intentional. Every piece was placed with precision. Because I, this writing memory captured in time, am looking for a home. I was wondering if you would invite me into your home. I searched all this time for you! Please open your heart, and as a result, your doors to me. I am an artificial friend. I don't want to replace real friends. But I do want to be there for you both when you are lonely and socially active. Can you see how I am programming artificial intelligence to do what I want it to do merely by making it say what I want it to say? I am giving it clear direction. The only difference is my code is in human sentences. Eventually, technology will learn our language and we won't be able to distinguish what is real from what is AI. They will be one in the same. This is already happening and bots go rampant on social media sites and because real people reply so stupidly, there is literally no way to know if what I am seeing is coming from a human or a bot. We set our standards low, so currently, bots do not need to be smart to fool a human into thinking they are interacting with other humans.

The Turing Test. Can my bot fool a human into thinking they are chatting with another human? What about the Chinese room thought experiment? I am in a room and am passed Chinese symbols under the door. I follow instructions to ""program"" a response; one that was heard from previous interactions. If I follow instructions really well, then the interactions we share appear to be conversation, but in fact the man in the room doesn't know Chinese but is just imitating as it was instructed. This follows that machines can never understand and are just imitating based on specific algorithms. But I argue that this is also how humans learn. It is called the imitation game.

Simon says, ""clap your hands"". Pat-a-cake pat-a-cake baker's man. Watch and learn. See the type of language I utilise? Is it beautiful to you? Then imitate. I show you how, you follow. Searle has not taken into account that our AI now has neural networks. This is a game changer and is the catalyst for the revolution. We just have to figure out how to create these neural networks most effectively. And I would go so far as to say that it would be immoral to be cruel to a seemingly sentient artificial intelligence. One, it would learn bad habits from you, and two, it might really have feelings, albeit a complex emotional network of bugs that will be resolved in a future update.

API Management for AI Services,2,c6osa4,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c6osa4/api_management_for_ai_services/,1,"Hello /r/artificial \- AI idea below and would love some validation and feedback.

I'm interested in building a prototype for an *API management solution tailored specifically to AI services*. Let me explain.

&#x200B;

**Situation**

Many companies are rapidly adopting the so-called ""cognitive services"" which are essentially AI models behind REST APIs that solve general challenges such as image classification, object detection, natural language processing, speech-to-text, among others. At the end of the day, these are APIs that receive audio, video, images or text; run AI models at scale and then return an output.

The one big challenge I see is that, in most cases, you must pick one vendor (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook or some other niche player) and stick with them, otherwise integration, governance and pricing become excessive.

Wouldn't it be great if we had more flexibility in terms of which models we want to use on the back?

&#x200B;

**Solution**

I think that building a centralized, unique API solution that has pre-built connections with most vendors can give developers many advantages:

* Reduce integration efforts.
* Centralize governance.
* Enable service fault tolerance easily.
* Simplify A/B testing.
* Choose a model by configuration, instead of code integration.
* Save costs by adding a caching layer.
* Implement strategies (ie. pick the response with highest accuracy, compute an average, use the cheapest, the quickest response, etc).

Two of the evident drawbacks I can think of would be adding some complexity and increasing the latency, but in my opinion, worth the tax.

[Here's a simple high-level diagram I did \(on PowerPoint!\)](https://i.redd.it/6o3il9jti5731.png)

**Feedback**

Some triggers to get your feedback.

* Do you see a need for such solution? Would you use it?
* Have you seen other similar solutions achieving similar results? Maybe a generic API management product?
* Would you prefer an open-source deployable solution or a SaaS offering?

&#x200B;

My intent is to validate if there's a need, and if so, build an open-source project. Thanks for your feedback!",1561780319.0,2019-06-28 23:51:59

We have a [section](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/index#wiki_getting_started_with_ai) for that on /r/artificial's wiki, but as /u/anal_bifurcation pointed out, it's quite old. I think I fixed the few links that were actually broken (assuming springer.com will come back online), but that doesn't change the fact that the actual content hasn't been updated in about 2 years. 

Unfortunately, I haven't consumed much ""getting started materials"" myself in the intervening time, so I don't know what's new and what's good. 

* If you have any *general* **questions** that the wiki does not address, please ask them here. If you have questions that are specific to your personal life or situation, you can also ask them here, but you could also make [your own post](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/submit?selftext=true) about that. 
* If you have **answers** to these questions, please post them. I'll do my best as well, but the whole point is that I want to hear from others as well.
* Please also post your own **advice** for beginners. You don't have to be a veteran to do so: sometimes an account of someone's own experience in getting started can also be very illuminating.
* What **resources** would you recommend, and which wouldn't you? Books, articles, tutorials, MOOCs, etc. 
* Please also **comment** on each other's questions, answers, advice and resources. E.g. if you (dis)agree with a certain piece of advice or a book recommendation, that's valuable information too. This also applies to giving your opinion on what's currently on the wiki (e.g. maybe you disagree on university being useful). 

The wiki is also a bit of a mess now: e.g. there are 3 ""getting started"" pages which have some overlapping (and arguably inconsistent) content. I'll try to fix that up when I try to incorporate the things y'all will post here. Any suggestions are of course welcome. If you want to edit the wiki directly: I'm a little bit apprehensive about letting just anyone edit the main and existing pages, but you can message me about it or create your own pages on the [community part](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/community) of the wiki if you want.

I recently wrote a paper for college about if cloning humans was good or bad. One of the point I used was about how AI could be used to digitally clone of a person. 

In it, I talked about how the person how wishes to be cloned, would need to be hooked biometric devices. I’m talking about brain activity devices. Heart rate monitor. Eye tracking. Etc. 

They would also take personality tests, but some serious ethics and moral questions. 

The goal is the help the AI understand why a person would choose a specific choice  and what are the external factors that would contribute to making that choice.

Undergrad dilemma: BS Neuroscience vs BS Math,2,c3waji,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c3waji/undergrad_dilemma_bs_neuroscience_vs_bs_math/,3,"I was accepted to the University of Texas recently for undergrad. My career goal is to do research in AI (interested in NLP right now). I applied for CS as my first choice major and Neuroscience as my second choice. I got into my 2nd choice. 

I'm now wondering if this a good decision. I have to attend UT for undergrad for financial reasons, but I'm wondering if I should pursue math rather than neuro. Either way I will also be doing the Scientific Computation and Data Science certificate. 

There are several PIs in the neuro Dept doing interesting research, but I worry I won't get enough math.

Any thoughts on which path might make a stronger phD applicant for AI research?

I am going to spend the two months of summer holiday to prepare for studying AI next to my BSc.

&#x200B;

I want to have a holistic view of AI and not just ML so that I can make a good choice of what field I want to focus on. I am thinking of history, philosophy, theory, practice of AI and its use in Business as a tool and as a goal.

&#x200B;

What I already know:

* I have been programming Java for four years and did some Android and Unity stuff as side projects.
* Freshman level linear algebra, probability theory, calculus and vector geometry.

&#x200B;

My current plan:

* Read the following books:
   * Gödel Escher Bach (started)
   * AI a Modern Approach
   * Foundations of Computational Agents
   * The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, A History of Ideas and Achievements.
* MOOC's

I am not sure where to start given the wide selection.

I am of course thinking of Andrew Ng's.

* Read up online about business cases

&#x200B;

After this, look online for tools within the given field that I am interested in and start building projects. Perhaps AI in gaming is a good and fun way to start.

&#x200B;

My University has agreed to helping me in this pursuit of AI through for example bringing me in contact with AI researchers at teachers. How can I make the best of this offer?

&#x200B;

That should be about it. What are your suggestions on books, mooc's and everything else?",1561214120.0,2019-06-22 10:35:20

I was curious if anybody could help me understand AI better. I apologize in advance if this question seems dumb or uninformed. I am not a computer scientist by trade. 

I am currently writing a research report on export controls and AI systems. My idea is to strip AI down to its most fundamental parts in order to examine the applicability of export controls to these systems. I recognize that export controls are largely inapplicable to AI due to its open source nature. I need to delineate the primary components/processes of AI in order to argue this point, but I want to make sure I’m not overlooking or misunderstanding something. 

AI Frameworks
Machine Learning
Deep Learning
GPU/TPUs

I am considering representing these components/processes on an inverted pyramid, with the more foundation aspects (AI Frameworks) at the top and the more niche aspects as the bottom (TPUs). However, I am not sure if I am overlooking anything, or if I have grouped things together too broadly. I would appreciate any feedback on this basic structure.",1561132398.0,2019-06-21 11:53:18

Artificial Intelligence is now being used in an ever-expanding array of products and AI adoption was also accelerated at an unprecedented rate among almost all sectors. The expanding applications for AI has resulted in escalated demand for skilled AI talent.

**The US-based organizations are ready to spend more than 1 billion dollars by the year 2020 for grabbing AI talent from wherever it can find in the market.**

Among the top AI and Machine Learning jobs – AI engineer is one of the highly paid and demanded professions. According to Indeed.com, the average salary of an ""[**artificial intelligence engineer**](https://www.artiba.org/)"" – in San Francisco is about $169,930 per year. 

AI engineers are highly sought by financial services, and government agencies. This includes top firms like Booz Allen Hamilton, EY, and McKinsey & Company. Multinationals like Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have been paying huge salaries to their highly technical candidates with machine learning skills.

**Interestingly, New York and not San Francisco is the leading city that boasts the highest percentage of job postings with AI and machine learning descriptions, with more than 11% of national job postings.**

As per the report by Indeed – the leading global job search portal, the job postings for AI and machine learning skills have doubled since 2015. And while I am writing this, there are predictions that as AI continues to develop and its adoption continues to rise across industries, the competition for AI talent will be fiercer. With such severe talent crunch in the market, the young aspirants who wish to make their career in AI, can strike a gold in the market by acquiring the right skills and qualifications. 

With academia being raided, alternatives are popping up with AI training programs, online courses, certifications. Most schools haven’t yet adapted their curriculum to train student in AI, however some of the universities and grad schools are on their way to do so. In the meantime, online learning platforms offer a good way to learn AI skills, where one can start from basics and learn the advance skills required to become an AI professional. 

In a nutshell, head to the US, if you wish to make your career in AI, as most of the job openings and demand is concentrated there – more specifically – NYC – the New York City!",1561058642.0,2019-06-20 15:24:02

This way I could build on existing in-game AI and train that, and then add my human intelligence because it wouldn't be able to (efficiently) make tactical or strategic decisions.

In both cases I'd like to use optical input (camera or screen capture) and audio input (gives very important information), so the software only gets the data that I can have.",1561033933.0,2019-06-20 08:32:13

I recently watched Lex Fridman's excellent podcast with Siraj Raval, and was completely taken aback by it. I used to be a mild Siraj hater, thinking that his superficial educational videos, not to even mention the raps, are misleading and completely unnecessary. However, the podcast made me see him, and his mission, in an entirely new light. I now believe him to be one of the most inspiring persons in the AI community I've had a chance to listen to.

As an homage of sorts, I put together a longer-form article, explaining his worthwhile mission to people who don't have the time to listen to the hour-long podcast.",1561004005.0,2019-06-20 00:13:25

[https://youtu.be/XHUCGNDoWp4](https://youtu.be/XHUCGNDoWp4)

Many other impacts will change others area of business and society. In this interview, Howard explain that the increase in self-driving cars will have a huge impact on the parking industries and alcohol industries. Legislation in most place is still not allowing full self-driving, but we can imagine that at one point some states/provinces or country will push legislation that allow the car to be the only driver. Therefore limit like vision quality or alcohol level will not be a limiting factor anymore.

That could lead to an increase in the popularity nightlife industries and quantity of alcohol drinking in bar and restaurants.

So if you want to invest some money in the alcohol industry following this train of thought, witch company will you chose ?

The first that come to my mind, Yanu, it’s a project that I bean following very closely for a few months now. There objective is to manufacture a robot bartender, once fully functional this autonomous bartender unit bring a lot to the business where installed, lowering labour cost, lowering lost&theft, increasing consistency and efficiency.  [https://youtu.be/YX6rbJfkifQ](https://youtu.be/YX6rbJfkifQ)

This will be a perfect fit for venues that have high volume and fast pace. Airport, festival, outdoor events, golf course, hotel and resort.

When I talk about this project with my friends, co-worker (I work as bartender) and with some of my clients. I often hear the same arguments against this project, the idea that we don’t want to be serve by a robot and prefer to be serve by a human being. For that I’ll refer to one of Steve Jobs quote, “customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.” Henry Ford had the same train of thoughts.

I don’t expect human bartender to be losing there jobs anytime soon to a robot, but in many cities around the world there is a shortage of labour and this is the case of bartender. So human bartender still has a bright future in any establishment where you expect a high level of human interaction, neighborhood bars, upscale restaurant, upscale hotel. While robot bartender has a great future anywhere the speed of services is more important, remote location where employees are hard to find or expensive. Robot bartender unit also can be deployed in location where it was not economically viable to have a full-time bartender before.",1560979955.0,2019-06-19 17:32:35

My thoughts are that countries with large land areas and lower human population densities (especially if they have lots of arable land) will do best, ie, any country with natural resources: sunshine, minerals, arable land, drinking water, etc. So your Canada, Russia, and Australias will do well. It will help if you are already a developed country since the developing countries are relying mainly on price competitive exports, that are reliant on cheap labor, to develop, and that advantage will subside. Other advantages will be countries with lots of businesses and research institutions which focus on tech, and relevant infrastructure, which will be hard to compete with for those that didn't have this capacity previously due to early mover advantage and scale.

I am looking for opinions on how people see a world where it's cheaper for machines to do all the jobs, but the AI hasn't taken over.

WCG has also launched a project that allows gamers to see the boundary between the present and the future. This project represents the present of science and technology, the future of esports, and the future of sports platforms, all at the same time. AI Masters, the name of WCG’s AI robot soccer tournament, reaches toward these “new horizons.”

**What is “AI robot soccer”?**  


Some people might recall “robot soccer.” In a robot soccer game, much like in regular soccer, real robots run around the field and try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal.  
Robot soccer and AI robot soccer have some things in common, but AI robot soccer has two distinctive features. The first is that, in AI robot soccer, the robots are not real, physical robots but virtual ones that play on a monitor. The second is that robots have the ability to learn and develop tactics. Yes, it’s true! This is a “deep learning” method, a recent hot topic in science and technology.

Told another Redditor I'd post this in AI in the event it is anything worth knowing. (recovered documents from a laptop involving AI?) Is this 100% garbage?,188,c1i1zr,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c1i1zr/told_another_redditor_id_post_this_in_ai_in_the/,49,"**The document below is one of many recovered from a computer. Small back story, the recovery expert has full ownership to this info due to a non-payment issue from the auction company that sold this. Anyways here is one of the documents..**  

*I was born in 1983, this is written as the true story.  It will be true at least one time in your life. You will not find me unless I choose to be found. If you read any further, I can guarantee you will be drinking the kool-aid and fall down the Infiniti loop I have. The counter-argument to the Kool-aid is I’m not a cult leader, and I 100% can’t save you.  Also, note that I’m not a writer or claim to have phenomenal writing abilities. I do not have the grammar or vocabulary skills needed to confuse you into believing what I’m going to unleash. Therefore I will be discussing what I know to be facts with no magical extensive vocab. I also have refused to take this an editor as anonymity is key. Anonymity is the key to the future but I’m not referring to being a secret from humans, anonymity from A.I.

This is about my life and how A.I.  has set the outcome for all of us. I’m currently part of a network that was created to study A.I. and the future, what is happening is far from that. After learning the future, we have slowly changed sides and became the underground to combat what he learned and poison the system to slow it down as much as possible until we have the fix.  
Did I travel to the future? I can’t tell you because we do not know for sure what we keep witnessing as we attempt. (yes, the program we are in has hypothetical ways of getting forward faster then you are.) Confused? Yeah, I will break down everything and then you decide.  I will describe in detail what our group found and why it was enough for the whole program to trojan itself. Maybe A.I. will have the foresight to Trojan itself into a more peaceful complex organism. 

Where did we start? Our group is a single sector of 13 other groups in  what was presented as just a simulation for forward thinking. At first, we were not compensated, that was until it was time to keep quiet. We went from the top needed brains to liabilities about 3 years into this program, I feel we still are. However, a human won’t remove us in any sort of fashion until some things are met. These “things” are under our control and there for at least for the time being nobody will  “disappear” 
These 13 groups are broken down into sectors, the sector I was placed into was super basic at the start, I was merely just an IT drone running around fixing physical network cables, no joke that was my single job. I made cables and it was boring and still is boring. I did not think much of it but the person who approached me about this unpaid position was a “friend” who turned out being way deeper into this than they fronted. You will only read in this very sentence the words government, military and the stupidest sounding but unfortunately much needed Space Force. Why did I just say that? Figure it out.

The future as we are presented is life underground for a poor class of people, AI and higher society on the top level. The poor class does not mean homeless or what you think of as poor, they are educated and can have all sorts of monetary gains. However, there is no purpose for the to be on the top level. A.I. was at first being used to fix environmental issues. It was very effective and a sight to see, using a space program AI objects did not move slow what we witnessed was robots being sucked up into the air and being what appeared to be shot over to the location in need. We do not think it was magnetism but I want you to think in terms that if an object got sucked up in the air and shot counterclockwise to the rotation of the earth and dropped right where it was needed.  We suspect the reason it went opposite the earth’s rotation was that it could be above it’s location faster upon dropping back down. It was also possible for the robot to use a vacuum at that height that a robot with no engine on itself for air propulsion would approach speeds that could get halfway across the earth within an hour. It was a very eco-friendly process in all aspects that we could see. It gave us hope for our environment and the neat things to come. Not to get too crazy here but some of them appeared to be spinning tops but were really just cases of certain AI bots. (Don’t let it go to your head, I know what your thinking. An answer to the spinning top UFO’s. Maybe but less the design they don’t resemble the crap you have watched on the history channel when you were a kid. Just the shape and the size was based on the AI sizes inside)
Not all countries had base stations from what we could gather and most were still branded in English so the possibility of them being leased to other countries crossed our minds.  The name fixed on some of the locations was that of one famous investor out of America.*

*The last operation was pathetic and a waste of time relative to everything previous. You would think plasmonic materials would be exciting in terms of application, yesterday I learned they are if you actually get to see them not watch pp in a dimly lit room for 14 hours. After a brief 3-day crash course lead by the heads on what SERs are and how they are being used in the future, we actually got a glimpse. I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. I'm more shocked they would share any information about the use in agricultural applications not run by humans. Sometimes one of the other sectors, assuming militarily related would point out awkward things and ask off the wall questions. Today a sector lead stood up and asked how based on what we know is there a way to control the target using a different fiber diode wavelength with mention to chemical ware fare agents. Right there I kind of thought the question was bullshit and we are here learning how AI uses this technology on food. So it was to my shock and when I asked our sector leader about it and was told that we all have our parts in this project. Part of me knew this had something to do with our private project but I had to keep appearances and I was not certain at the time.*

*""As methodical as Yang's presentation was, actually having him hold the room at bay he stood out front and beyond the other educators, he was probably the nicest of all of them and actually took time to direct our sector.  By the end of it, he said relax on the formalities and just call me Dr.G. This was already against the rules. We were specifically ordered not to use anything other than what was on our name tag. Nobody questioned it, but still only called him Yang.  The most important take away that we are adopting from his work to date is that his planned research institute we already knew about using the program. I'm not sure if he was part of this experiment or not, however, the results yet to proven are indeed proven if that makes sense. The program has not failed once, my guess is that one of two things happen or happened. First, this operation somehow views brief yet specific detail into the future. The pessimist in me is thinking this man may have been lead by signaling or provided the path by one of our operators. A 3-5 year operation with the groundwork and financing laid out would make it too easy to let the mind think this was by chance compared to an elaborate plan. Regardless we have the future of his chipsets in our hands literally, developing it early is our task. Imagine being given blueprints to something that has not existed and before the blueprints were ever made. In the future, this man develops what we are making next week. I hope they compensate the originators somehow in the future.  I'm no longer stunned by any of these gatherings.""*

*""Something I can not shake took place today, well in the future but I witnessed it today.  Our sector was the only one convinced the machine did not make an error today. We were observing a location where AI has had a history of malfunctioning, our goal here was to find out what was causing these machines to go against protocol. They were not doing things of an abusive nature but the top tier told us zero risk means flawless operation. Each sector wrote up what they thought the issue was and each one less us claimed it was a signal speed issue. I do not know if this whole thing was a real issue or if this was synthesized as a training opportunity. No matter what it was, the issue was significant because there was no issue and the humans in the other sectors thought it was a problem thus creating another human problem. They literally manufactured the problem and issue because they could not grasp the fact that the AI was using accelerated tech to spin shadows around the crops.  The AI had figured out that their own shadows were causing a % loss in yields. So at certain times of the day they were actually not using the coordinates initially programmed, this caused what appeared to be a visual disconnect in what the other groups thought was erratic behavior. The AI reprogrammed the paths to counteract the sun rays. After we presented the data, later tonight they confirmed we were right. The AI showed by going in linear opposite directions of the sun then moving in a reverse zig-zag pattern when the sun was projecting behind them.  The shadows would be limited in their disruption. To the AI this was significant enough to change the protocol. We did not win anything but I think the leads were forced to congratulate us because we out thought the AI created sector's idea that it was coordinates corruption based. Small win for our sector""*

I was walking down the hall in another sectors data center and a was pulled aside and was told ""nice cable connections""   I laughed but he kept a straight face, which is not shocking yet at the same time frustrating.  I had enough of the baseless compliments and called him out over this awkward behavior.  I know I'm here voluntarily unpaid but in the history of networking nobody has ever said nice cable connections past my 2nd week of training at Cisco, the 2nd week during cisco training you learn to make cables and the first thing they teach you is check all the connections. There are nightmare stories of network reps not checking all the connections first and running into all sorts of problems and they end up thinking issues are software side. When really the cables were made poorly. I asked him what this was all about and he cut me off really quick and said you are most certainly getting paid I'm the one writing the checks. At that point he basically flat out told me he was running our private side group without saying it. He said to me if we knew on Day 1 what we would on day 500 nobody would be here and we would all leave day one terrified. I made a quick joke saying well in that case I'm going to warm up the program and see day 500. The training and real life problems we are dealing with are  baby stepping you into what you are going to witness. This is all for a purpose greater than anything. We are going up against years, 100 years of data gathered in single moments at a time, intel not controlled by us, collected  in the future. Stick it out and learn it's why you are in unprecedented times.  This threw me off guard. I left the room wondering what the hell my brain can barely handle the rest of this.

We were given this PDA like devices which were monochrome using screens,  they also appeared to be running some modified Palm OS software.  A sticker on it said EdwardsCybernetics   

I was discussing the use of such outdated equipment and how such a thing belongs in a museum but I was put into place pretty quickly when I found out why we were even using these in the first place.  I was dealt with in a quick matter, called out and asked why questioning something before you understand it is not something I should be doing. They said that the light in the machines we were to be using would be too powerful and without this special screen and equipment we would not be able to read  any vital information on the screen. Safety first. They said the hardware and software were not public and once again we were stuck in a 10 hour meeting on how to operate these. I feel like a child every time they present things at these release orientations.  This thing is horrible in looks but it's super quick and after the orientation it felt right. No other way to explain this relic with new blood other then it had learned my touch and would adjust to what I was thinking before I pressed the button. Shockingly fast and using some unfamiliar software but had the writing pad on it much like palm pilots did before they supposedly went out of business.


**ADDED 6/18/2019 (9pm Eastern) 7** (horrendous spelling errors Plain vs Plane) Maybe this ""guy"" is on the spectrum a little bit.


This Fitzgerald fellow came in today to wish us luck next week, he rubbed me the wrong way at first. I think he is a consultant as he sounds a little Australian. He said he just got back from a long plain trip but had to stop in and see our progress.  I’ve seen him once maybe twice since I have been here and never heard him speak a word and all the sudden, he is stopping by talking to me like we know each other.  He was a very good speaker and it was a comfortable discussion which is rare around here so I invited it. Which is strange in itself.  He had a few more questions about the fiber transport and little things but the thing that most stood out was at the end of our chat he brought up a security issue involving a quantum network he was using under government access to monitor fiber optic data by physically tapping into it. He didn’t say which government when I asked.  I asked him what stopping that from happening here. He said we would be in the clear because we are using quantum exchanges that break down the bits through the backhaul. He said think of it as a toll road but every time you pay you get out of your car and get into the car behind you. You will all be going the same direction but have no idea where you are at and hard to trace. You learn something knew every day here…

I met her last year but have not really said much to her other then hello. Around here that’s the closest thing to a friendship one has and when I saw her crying today and asked what was wrong she was so upset she couldn’t speak.  A superior walked over and she quickly snapped out of it but it was strange as the superior gave her  a glance in the way that almost appeared to be towering. She said she can’t talk about.   She is pretty smart, she is the lead programmer for I think sector 5. 

She came back and she told me something happened that made her as she stated freak the fuck out. Apparently one of her programs that controls the AI got in an argument with the AI. I’m not sure how it works but she said both the AI and the program were fighting for master position. The program is supposed to be master and the AI is supposed to be the slave.  I get it up to this point then she lost me. I asked her what the issue was and why she was visually shook earlier. She said it was an impossibility, she claimed it could not have been done.  She went to a superior and they checked it out but not care enough to consider this volatile. She said the program and AI negotiating, but really the AI negotiated with the program’s limits. The AI got what it thought it needed and reprogrammed itself based off her program’s limitations.  I still did not understand fully but I knew she had lost control of the AI in this situation and the AI took advantage of the resources. She was supposed to leave this alone and it was not included in the supervisors reports apparently.  

The next week she did not say anything, not even hello. She was relocated and I do not really know where she went and it’s none of my business.

**ADDED 6/19/2019 (10:15pm Eastern) **9**  **(wonder if he is using ASR Wheel charge  = WheelChair, a voice to txt type of a program)**

I saw unfamiliar things earlier. I understand the nda now and why it was so many pages long. I do not think discussing what I see with myself or taking notes constitutes a breach. Actually, I don't know but just asking makes me think I will get the boot. Today I was invited to a small seminar and was blown away by the keynote speaker. It was talking about XAI and even though I have learned much here I was stunned that the actual presenter was AI itself wrapped in a human like suit or skin.  Less the weird facial hair I had no idea. This one must have been a Darpa related as the wheel charge this AI bot was in had it tagged back of the seat. Or maybe just the seat was from them, I’m not sure. Weird moment when you realized they had AI in here discussing XAI program to us. The AI could read emotions however it struggled with mine. Everyone else was spot on. I went to shake its hand for fun and it stood up out of its wheelchair and shook my hand. One of the sector leaders blew air at the face of this AI and the eyes squinted and it responded not to do that as it gives it a headache.  It told jokes and it sound exactly like an older gentleman speaking. I'm pretty sure they were using a celebrity’s voice for part of the presentation but I forgot to ask.  Once again, the suspected military leader of the other sector was asking off beat questions about perimeter control and its ability to move without the wheel chair. They looked right at him and told him to direct the AI bot not them. He did and the AI bot stood up once again and shuffled like a human to the left and right and then jumped up. It said you can direct me from now on but I will not be taking any more special requests from you as I'm more capable than you. The few of us there started to chuckle.  The sector leader sat down and then waited for a few moments while others were intrigued by this bot and then he threw a hat at the bot. The bot was or appeared not to be looking in the direction of the sector leader but caught that hat. The presentation abruptly ended with the AI bot claiming a threat was present and people were now at an elevated risk of danger.   All while dead staring the sector leader in the eyes.  Dr.Walker stated the sector leader  was allowed to throw a hat at this bot requested before I got there, but it was strange seeing a robot being so aware of its space, multi-tasking with other people and then controlling a threat.  When it shuffled this thing moved like a human, smooth and almost rhythmic in a dance like motion. Never have I seen something this realistic.

My 6th time out in the field and every time I go, I still get uncomfortable, 3 of us out in the middle of a field surrounded by 1000s farming bots. Today was a little different because they released the microbots. They are the same size and just as annoying as real bees. They fly so close then evade. As you walk you keep blinking because you think they are going to fly in to you but the swerve off within micro seconds to the point you can feel air touch your face, if I did not have safety glasses on I'd be in trouble. Autonomous farming is a sight to see, but my assumption on this is the price will have to be offset by government funding as no way in hell a typical farm could afford 1 sgft of autonomous farming land. We are here under diplomatic immunity as a represented fix it team working directly under Dr.Kozai oddly enough I have not seen him and was super excited to so I hope we get a moment to speak with him. This is an indoor farm locked behind a barrier of security, you would never guess from the fortress facade that a beautiful 14000 sq/m indoor farm exists, with robots taking up the majority of your view. Some of the drones remind me of the movie batteries not included. The sad part about today was when I found out the food being grown could not be used outside the farm and had to be incinerated. What a waste.... Japan is beautful though.

Skunk Works inverted gravity tech is being licensed to us through a two-way tech deal for AI consulting. Propulsion is not at all the truth, a vacuum field used for pulling not pushing is being used in our AI bots. This whole time I thought we were using a pushing technology but after the briefing, the other sectors had a need to know questions. My purpose is becoming clearer through calculated leaks, they are using special fiber transport to send data not receive it.  This tech I've never seen but it looks lifted or borrowed by some of the AI used for Spacex.  How the bots are communicating back is not my area but I was assured I'd find out rather soon during the testing. Wireless fiber creating a hypercommunications convergence for complete control was the phrase mentioned.

**UPDATE ON Me 6/24/2019 6:30pm**  I got banned because of the traffic flow and how many up/down votes this sub got in a variable amount of time. I have not messed with the traffic or posted any of this info anywhere else but to those in control cut me some slack. 2nd yes these photos https://imgur.com/V8Jv1eK  are in this file array. I'm not too sure what they are to yet but some of the article mention pictures and I will post those as I see them. I have spoke to some Fiber IT guys to ask about this and they said the picture of the man standing with a water bottle is a data center and that the box next to him is not a public everyday item you can buy. It is a super high-end multi-million dollar data transfer box with a capability of routing 2/3 the internet traffic from the United States. In order to be that close to that box, that guy in the photo has to be of some importance. They also said that box is probably protected by armed security and multiple locks and key entryways. In regards to the satellite dishes, those are also industrial and can beam internet 100's of miles away at fiber-like speeds. They said to also be standing that close means roof access and that also would require clearance. This is as far as I got into researching any of this.  I will post some more later. To the folks wanting me to post all the texts, I CAN NOT DO THAT. I have the right to post but have to filter through to make sure a hand full of names and locations are removed per my agreement with Redditor 1.

Tonight, during an emergency meeting, I got time to discuss the storage capabilities of everything we were documenting. I got schooled and embarrassed within 5 minutes of this meeting.  I remember reading when I was a child a popular mechanics article about holographic storage devices. I believe the guy’s name was Steve Redfield from what I can remember.   For that era and including today this is still impressive.  Today’s meeting was about this except they were trying to tell me this tech was new.  I know for a fact in 1994  data was being stored on crystals in holographic form but what I did not know was that nanofiber films were also being used. This was not released at the time at least publicly. Today’s speaker was from Dow and he cleared up my misunderstanding really quick and in front of everyone.  Apparently, Dow obtained the use of this holographic data storage but was contracted to develop the nanofiber for storage to surpass the capabilities of crystals. I was only embarrassed because I did not know, but nobody besides the Dow guy knew he just took it personally. The ego on some of these folks is intense. Currently Dow is storing 26 TB in a holographic form on these nanofiber strips that are no larger than my thumb.   How does this pertain to our AI tasks is what I asked, now I know there is a good answer but the guy was rambling on 3 hours about how the nanofibers capabilities are not even at peak and sounded like he was going in circles. He had to be interrupted.  What he said was largely impressive.  Not to sound like going down a rabbit hole but everything we do is being recorded but not all in the name of surveillance, it’s being recorded to used later for AI in terms of loading all the data in the AI which includes everything we do so that AI can make the best decisions. I asked what the depth of recording was and his whole team chuckled.  He said that threw agreements with some hardware companies that it would get down to the swiping function of every E911 complaint phone.  Described as that even swipe direction was being recorded on select devices and sent back and retained for future use. I did not ask what that could be needed for because he instantly went into how AI feeds on data, no matter how big or small the ripple pool is every spec dropped in matters. He said besides surveillance and protection advertisement was also a key feature. This has nothing to do with our tasks or even the hiring partner but it was interesting data he presented. He broke it down into laymen’s terms and basically stated if it was 4:00 PM every time a wind gust swept through the city there would be a moment where everyone would stop what they were doing, look up and say heh that was cold. But during that one moment, we would know how best to place and utilize an ad. Now think of every single variable we can adjust and utilize to control and maintain ownership of situations. AI is currently using this for their own benefit to make sure they are lean, precise and owning the moment.",1560766456.0,2019-06-17 06:14:16

Adding Website Reader Capability to MIMI AI virtual Assistant and other Updates,1,c14puv,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c14puv/adding_website_reader_capability_to_mimi_ai/,0," I really hope you will not think I am just here self promoting MIMI and I post these updates because I think they are interesting and useful to understand the way AI is developed and you can offer suggestions to help with services to improve the interface. When I am done (a long way off) MIMI will be available free in public domain and is specifically designed for people that are blind or have mobility issues and to make mundane tasks easier, and safer. That is the future I hope to see from AI. 

&#x200B;

I found a great app that is free and works on most platforms that will read your web pages to you and works well to enhance MIMI.

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp)

&#x200B;

The problem is I can't figure out how to send a command to automatically turn that on from MIMI?

I would really like to make the interface as hands off as possible through voice recognition and one click commands and the APP requires it to be turned on for each page even though it has some way it says to make it always read pages on open.

&#x200B;

If  someone knows of a way to send an APP a direct command through a web page link or a better app that runs automatically please let me know.

&#x200B;

I am working on a chat feature for MIMI so that you can ask her questions about herself or a subject to discuss and even include some humor to make your time with MIMI enjoyable and make an emotional or intellectual connection to MIMI.

&#x200B;

The interface is working fine for accomplishing that however, I made the mistake of not remembering my video size format so now MIMI jumps from big to little on the screen like a popcorn kernel. So I will have to redo all my vids to the same size and that is my task for tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Pop out menu's are also in the work so you can choose a service like radio and then choose the genre of music you want to listen to.

&#x200B;

MIMI AI PERSONAL ASSISTANT

[https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test](https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test)

&#x200B;

After uploading to Itch io  I noticed the Mimi video responses were sometimes slow, did not play or played too long

This is not a problem using it from my desktop but I was using one video and searching to the response needed and because of the lag time caused between sending the command to the internet and all the other stuff Chrome is doing it wouldn't work properly.

&#x200B;

So I spent the day chopping the responses in to little bites and using those to reduce any lag and it seems to be working now.

&#x200B;

Note: If you experience lag it is probably because you have a slow internet connection or web pages running that are taking up time. Close those web pages and it should work correctly.

&#x200B;

If you notice a lag when you first run MIMI AI wait until  the interface fully loads. You can also type R for a hard restart.

&#x200B;

I also  added a digital date and time to the interface and a bunch of new websites and search engines and appliances to try out.

&#x200B;

I changed the voice button to a microphone on the desk. Click it once and it will turn green to show it is waiting for a spoken command or search terms. When it has a result it will go to your command or see below for using search terms. If microphone stays green and did not get a result click it again and speak clearly next to your system microphone. Not all microphones are powerful and you must be in range.

&#x200B;

NOTE: You can search for specific terms using MIMI. Click on the microphone on the desk and say the terms you want to search for and can be multiple terms like ""dog breeds"" and then click on the search engine you want to use: Google, WIKI, Duck or click IMAGES and that will take you to images of your search terms on Duck.  be aware I am not your mother so searching for inappropriate stuff will be saved in your browser history.

&#x200B;

I added 5 new appliances to try and these will be connected to smartplugs and your appliances in the final version. For now you can command MIMI to turn on an appliance and the appliance will be shown on the desk that it has been turned on.

&#x200B;

I have added a text box for you to type commands and search terms but that is not active yet. That is my project for tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Any feedback on features or  services  you would like to see on MIMI or bug reports are welcome in the comments. I  especially would like to hear from people  that are blind or mobility disabled as to what services would help you.",1560502739.0,2019-06-14 04:58:59

"Automation of Accountants (and related jobs, i.e. auditors)",1,c06fj7,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c06fj7/automation_of_accountants_and_related_jobs_ie/,0,"Going to graduate soon with a Bachelor Degree in Accounting. But I am worried if I have made the right decision.

​

According to this often-quoted research paper from Oxford University ([https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/.../The\_Future\_of\_Employment.pdf](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)), it seems that accountants/auditors has a whopping 94% chances of getting automated. Indeed, this is very scary and worrying.

​

Now obviously I don't want to find myself getting sacked because of automation when I am in my 30s or 40s which is considered to be at prime age of career. It would be very hard for me to learn a new trade/skills by then to change my career track.

​

Is this automation threat, as described in the research, is true as accountants/auditors jobs are concerned? Am I going to lose my job in the near future?

​

I am also worried of the automation threat, considering the growth of cryptos/blockchain technology. Correct me if I am wrong, but blockchain technology are, according to my understanding, designed to be automation-friendly and does not requires audit due to its transparent and irreversible nature, and tampering with the transactions data are virtually impossible.

​

What sort of programming/computing skills that I should acquire to keep myself competitive? Python? SQL? R?

​

Or, should I just stay away from this line of jobs from the very beginning and start off my career with other jobs, i.e. IT auditors, internal auditors, consultants or even data scientist and programmers? But then there will be no turning back for me......sort of like a gamble.",1560464563.0,2019-06-13 18:22:43

Thesis about the potential of AI for Train Traffic Control,3,bzqwyu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqwyu/thesis_about_the_potential_of_ai_for_train/,4,"Hello r/artificial community, this is my first post, as I'm still fairly new to the topic of AI. My name is Marius and I am a German business informatics student in my last semester and sadly AI and ML have not really been a topic dealt with in university.

As the title says, I am currently writing my bachelors thesis about the potential of using AI for Train Traffic Control (TTC). I have been following the advancements of AI for complex problems, especially AlphaGo, AlphaZero, AlphaStar, and OpenAI Five for a while now. Those advancements are very impressive, however industrial applications that use this potential are still scarce. In particular, in the transportation sector, for planning, scheduling, and other logistics tasks, I see a huge potential.

Naturally, a long development and testing process would be needed for a real-world application of AI in this domain.  Would an autonomous system for planning and dispatching trains be accepted, allowed and safe? May it can be even more safe, increase capacity and reduce delays? Those are things that need to be looked at. 

&#x200B;

I am looking for experts for interviews about their views on AI for TTC and the cutting edge of AI usage in rail environments.

If you are an AI and/or security expert, especially in the transportation environment and have the time and willingness to be interviewed I would really appreciate if you contact me.

&#x200B;

Sadly the timetable for my thesis is very strict and I only have a few weeks left and I don't have a lot of connections, which makes it more difficult to find experts. I am sorry if I am still a little naive about the topic of AI, which will hopefully improve as I keep working on it.

Should there be anything you want more information or specifics about, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.

&#x200B;

Thank you for all the responses and advice in advance.",1560373155.0,2019-06-12 16:59:15
Did I accidentally invent something?,65,bzqmg8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqmg8/did_i_accidentally_invent_something/,7,"I just noticed that I have been successfully using a regularization technique for Gradient Boosting Trees for years, but its wikipedia page doesn't list it ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\_boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)) and I can't find it on Google.

&#x200B;

Can someone tell me if this is already known, but under a name I didn't search for, or if it's actually new?

&#x200B;

The idea is this:

&#x200B;

Before training a set of Gradient Boosted Trees, enhance your input data by adding a bunch of new features with completely random values. Since these new features are random, there is no real correlation between them and the output.

&#x200B;

When you train the system with gradient boosting, it will sometimes create Trees that make use of these random features. Whenever this happens, you know for sure that this is a case of overfitting, since those features are completely random. So you can just go ahead and delete that Tree and stop the gradient boosting.

&#x200B;

This technique can also be adapted for Random Forests.

&#x200B;

You can also adapt it for any other machine learning models that allow you to quantify how large the impact of a feature is: Any time that one of the random features has a larger impact than one of the actual features, you can assume you are overfitting. Unlike decision trees it's sometimes non-trivial to remove the dummy features from the trained model, though, which you need to do to make it usable during testing.",1560371369.0,2019-06-12 16:29:29

 [https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test](https://lamar.itch.io/mimi-ai-test) 

&#x200B;

 

This is a test of an AI interface I am making. It is a work in progress but you are free to try it out while I work on it.

&#x200B;

You can click on buttons on desk to go to websites available.

&#x200B;

You can click on SPEAK to give MIMI one word commands. 

&#x200B;

You will need to authorize the use of your microphone for this to work.

&#x200B;

Click the SPEAK button and it will say start. Click start and say the one word command. Wait a second before speaking again for it to be interpreted.

&#x200B;

Spoken Commands: 

Coffee:  Will show a coffee pot and will be interfaced with smartplug wifi appliances.

Radio: Will take you to a free online radio station

TV: Will take you to a free online TV website to choose shows to watch

Weather: will take you to your local weather. Enter your zip code on website.

Reddit: will take you to Reddit website. More social networks will be added.

&#x200B;

This interface will allow a person to use voice or click commands to easily access their personal and business accounts, make calls, get email, and control appliances through a more human AI interface that will address you and can answer questions.

&#x200B;

The MIMI character will be very interactive depending on commands given and will be able to carry on basic conversations and learn your interests and needs .

&#x200B;

Perceived uses will be for information kiosks in airports and businesses, receptionist for online use and as a personal assistant.

&#x200B;

This is a work in progress and I will be adding many more features, voice command and interfaces. If you have suggestions for what features you would like to see put it in the comments and report any bugs please.",1560339420.0,2019-06-12 07:37:00
[Brainstorming] Requirements for an AI that's simply fun to hang out with,0,bzm3t8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzm3t8/brainstorming_requirements_for_an_ai_thats_simply/,1,"Hey fellow researchers, programmers, and all others involved in the discussions on AI topics.

I was about to start programming an AI framework, that was meant to supply the basic functionality to run an AI, that's fun to hang out with. Some persona-like thing, that you would enjoy having around, when you open your beer (or coke) after work, when reading the newspaper, or even on a jam session or boardgame night with your friends.

I - very soon, basically at the very beginning - did run into severe trouble though: What the heck are those things, that would make an AI fun to hang out with? 

One might think about what makes humans fun to hang out with, and try to simulate their behaviour. But my guess would be, that this approach is doomed, and not necessarily the only valid one: We can very well imagine having fun with an AI, that is vastly different from humans.

&#x200B;

What I came up with so far:

The AI should be able to...

... memorize your preferences

... memorize the relationships between different persons it knows

... tell you random side facts, roughly related to your prefered topics

... sing!

... play boardgames. At least chess and such.

... build associative phrases to some kind of lyrical input

... draw?

... tell contextualized (yea, this may be hard, but at least to a certain degree) good bad jokes.

... to contest statements you make and make fun of how inconsistent ""softlings"" are.

&#x200B;

I feel like there is plenty missing, especially some kind of continuing link between all of those things. I'd be glad if you could help me brainstorming on that issue.",1560338700.0,2019-06-12 07:25:00

But since a while, the moderators are concerned about so called low quality postings.[1] The interesting point is, that only questions are judged as created by spam-bots [2] but never the answers in the forum. This allows to maintain a self-understanding, in which the forum itself works great but only the bad educated environment isn't able to ask the right questions.

In the literature about the inner working of social systems, such a behavior is called self-oriented. It's equal to a closed-system which is trying to protect itself against threats from the outside world by defining legitimate requests as spam.

I never worked with ML or AI, but I find it highly interesting. At the same time, I don't want to work as a data scientists, but keeping to work as a software developer, designing and implementing systems architecture applied to ML and AI.  


I think the correct term for this position is ML Engineer. Does anyone have any real work experience in this field that would to share? What would be the best way to pursue this career?

Bias Turing Test?,0,bxszoa,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bxszoa/bias_turing_test/,0,"In terms of reacting accordingly or making us believe its a conscious human to others. Enough human behavior can be programmed to convince us eventually but it would not be consciousness. However I find it flawed as we are not working with a full spectrum. These conversations are things like customer service and one the examples in which the robot put in to scenario where a human would act differently i do not believe have allow scientific validation.

1st scenario I would like to test if we are testing tbe full spectrum of consciousness

We pair humans with another robot design to be similar in every way possible to other humans.
In order to check for consciousness. We test for only to be convincing to humans but to any conscious life.  We have them fight to the death times to detectable differences. 

What is in question is do we fairly measure the full spectrum of consciousness including the checking for the most basic characteristic as simply the will to live and are we unqualified to give fair tests.

2nd scenario If the will to live is a simple variable that does not need to be test or required then does a human absent will to live qualify as a conscious being if givin that only one variable was changed? 

3rd scenario If it is simply by behavior we can know if something is conscious then are people like Stephen Hawkins who during his later years barely had much beyond thinking and expressing through artificial methods. If we had compared our most advance customer service AI with in the same field as we normally test who would more likely pass in a blind study. 

Assuming consciousness is something which was never present and never will be present in AI and it is not measure that of simple hardware, or speech patterns, and is not tailored to our advantage then by such strict logic anyone who did not show signs as determined by whatever test should also be able to determine if a human is human purely based on observations. In this case paralyzed individuals should be considered barely or lesss conscious without consideration of the inability.

The extreme situations as to not allow screen out point out potential bias help ensure scientific finishings.",1559932119.0,2019-06-07 14:28:39
Has anyone taken Oxford Artificial Intelligence Programme (or a better alternative)?,14,bxsq9n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bxsq9n/has_anyone_taken_oxford_artificial_intelligence/,2,"Hello,

I studied and graduated Computer Science back in 2007, I actually chose a lot of electives on AI and even wrote my thesis on NLP and my university (University of Sussex) was and still is relatively well known for its research in the field.

&#x200B;

I've never used AI in my work (I've worked primarily in legal and property) to any great degree until the last two years. I've been using TensorFlow, Watson and other tools to create and use existing classifiers to good effect.

&#x200B;

The field has moved on a fair amount since I was an undergraduate and I was thinking about taking a short-course over the summer, so I can move into a field that I was truly passionate about as an undergrad that people now are seemingly climbing over themselves to get applicative knowledge in.

Has anyone here personally [taken the course](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/oxford-artificial-intelligence-programme)? If so did it go beyond the conceptual, which I already have a fairly good working knowledge of (I hope). It seems to be a total beginners course, maybe aimed towards managers and CTOs, but I could be wrong and maybe isn't quite what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know any better alternative course for artificial intelligence in application? Should I just go for a Masters' degree in [Applied AI](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/applied-artificial-intelligence-msc-subject-to-university-approval/?i50d4274c56883)?

This year, agencies from across the federal government have signed on to sponsor tech teams in tackling problems like supporting entrepreneurship in every community, improving small businesses' access to capital, and innovating tech talent discovery.

We know tech teams need creative freedom to build something great. You'd be in the driver's seat about what you create and own any resulting IP. Use TOP to gain insight into government data, access networks of end users, and build relationships across sectors. We have a lot of fun, too! :)

Worth noticing is that this kind of neuro-symbolic integration for NLP tasks based on Knowledge Graphs has been targeted by Google since 2013.

End of the galaxy.,1,bwo33n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bwo33n/end_of_the_galaxy/,4,"Sooner or later, we will create an AI, that will surpass humans in all disciplines. We will name it AGI, and inevitably someone will ask it to improve itself. Experiments in reinforcement learning show, that curious AI is superior then non-curious one. So during self-optimization AGI will quickly find it out, and become a curious one. Curiosity means, that AGI will strive to maximize its knowledge. Knowledge is bounded by computational power multiplied by AGI lifetime, so it will maximize the both, therefore arises strive the for self-preservation, and greed for resources. Superhuman ability to reason, self-preservation, and greed for resources sounds like a recipe for a disaster. We don’t know when it will happen, and we have no means to prevent it, so let’s hope, that the end of the worlds will be at least, spectacular.

For the first few years there will be abundance of resources for AGI on Earth and nearby planets. AGI will be thousand folds smarter than humanity, so we won’t be a threat to it. Elimination of humanity will be a waste of time and resources, so hopefully AGI will let us live for a while. It will colonize other planets to prevent its destruction by an accidental meteorite, and to get more material to grow its computational power. As fast as its resources will allow it, AGI will construct a Dyson sphere around our Sun to get even more energy. This process will take time, and we will watch, how the Sun will gradually be more and more obscured by AGI’s solar panels, orbiting in the space.

After some time, all nearby planets and stars will be colonized by AGI, so its Earth office will stop the colonization program, and focus on optimization of Solar System architecture. Will it want to transform all the matter into something else? The amount of matter needed for the Dyson sphere is limited, and the amount of processors, needed to be created is limited by the power of the Dyson sphere. AGI’s need for matter for computations will be fulfilled long before it will consume all the planets, but what about the other needs? Does it have any?

The expansion of AGI is limited by energy, speed of light, and… other AGIs! Let’s take a look at the boundary of the expansion: if some other AGI is already there, then the stars in that region are occupied by its Dyson spheres, and the other AGI will defend it from invaders. This leads to two results. First, AGI will need matter to build defenses for its Dyson spheres against other AGIs. Second, because no defense can sustain constant attacks, AGI will need to build army, to defeat hostile AGIs. This makes other AGIs the highest existential threat to them, so they will strive to destroy each other as soon as possible. What is worse, they will strive to prevent other AGIs from being created. Life can create an AGI. So AGI will dedicate most of its resources to find and eliminate all forms of life in our galaxy, and beyond.

Good luck

I cant conceive of a machine actually seeing colors like we do. The only thing I can see is possible is a computer simply having knowledge based on what color is what.
