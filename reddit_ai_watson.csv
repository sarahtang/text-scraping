What is not an AI ?,0,5smr79,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/5smr79/what_is_not_an_ai/,7,"Hi !

I'm writing a small browser game and I'm currently writing an AI that mimics a player's actions.

But in the end it's just another algorithm that performs different actions … I was thinking about a small FSM, or a tiny behavior tree, and then a score-based decision table. It could also be a plain if/elseif suite ordered by priority.

But what is an AI ? What is not an AI ?

Why do you call certain algorithms AI ? It it because it's an agent, in an infinite loop ? Is it because of the use of b-trees, needs-tables or another this-is-an-AI-algorithm ? Is it because it mimics a human, animal (or robot :S) entity ?

So, what is the crucial difference between an AI and a mere algorithm ? Is it something I should especially focus on when I think I'm writing an AI.

Thank you :]

"Can people explain the largest, existing AI projects for me? (Deepmind, Watson, Alexa, Cortana, Viv, Nervana, etc)",44,5mnkbu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/5mnkbu/can_people_explain_the_largest_existing_ai/,18,"- Once you build the AI, how do you improve it? It was my understanding that the neural net is 100% dependent on the hardware it was trained to run on. Also, the trained neural net is kind of static, as improving it for some other task could hurt the learned previous ability, unless you isolate them in memory.

- Is Watson not the best natural language processor out there today? If it is, then why isn't it used in applications similar to Google Now, Alexa, Cortana, and Viv (now Samsung's property)? If it's not, why not?

- What exactly is Deepmind? I just watched a video overview from the front page here, but can someone tell me what it can already do besides win Go? Or are they trying not to focus on actual applications yet?

- What exactly is Watson? I can't figure out of it's just vaporware by IBM that isn't ahead of anything in the industry and is 100% static and un-upgradeable, or if it's cutting edge in its own way?

- Does Alexa and the team at Amazon have any chance at catching up with Google and/or IBM? How about Cortana or Viv?

- What does Intel's Nervana mean for machine learning going forward? As I understand it, they are close to releasing a chip that is 10x to 100x faster than GPUs for training neural nets, which I would think would make every single machine learning company want to use that hardware instead. And furthermore, it sounds like they want to hose their own AI in the cloud like the other projects I mentioned, but I can't figure out how that project is coming along or if it stands a chance at catching up with the others.

Parsing a block of natural language text and a separate sentence to derive a confidence level that one supports the other.,9,1zcew5,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1zcew5/parsing_a_block_of_natural_language_text_and_a/,10,"Hello /r/Artificial

I'm a comp sci graduate with a day job writing mundane non-AI software. While I find AI interesting it's not my area and I'm often surprised at what's possible so I'm asking for advice here. 

I'd like to make an application which can take 2 inputs, both in natural language and return some kind of a confidence level that one supports the other. 

For example the statement might be ""John Foster worked in LA""

and the text might be the entry from his IMDB profile.

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0287898/

I'd like it to give a higher confidence level to that statement based on that input than ,for example, the statement ""John Foster eats spiders""

How ambitious is this? is it crazy or reasonable? 

Are there good open source or off the shelf tools or packages for parsing natural language like this that I could use?

Has anyone taken Oxford Artificial Intelligence Programme (or a better alternative)?,14,bxsq9n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bxsq9n/has_anyone_taken_oxford_artificial_intelligence/,2,"Hello,

I studied and graduated Computer Science back in 2007, I actually chose a lot of electives on AI and even wrote my thesis on NLP and my university (University of Sussex) was and still is relatively well known for its research in the field.

&#x200B;

I've never used AI in my work (I've worked primarily in legal and property) to any great degree until the last two years. I've been using TensorFlow, Watson and other tools to create and use existing classifiers to good effect.

&#x200B;

The field has moved on a fair amount since I was an undergraduate and I was thinking about taking a short-course over the summer, so I can move into a field that I was truly passionate about as an undergrad that people now are seemingly climbing over themselves to get applicative knowledge in.

Has anyone here personally [taken the course](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/oxford-artificial-intelligence-programme)? If so did it go beyond the conceptual, which I already have a fairly good working knowledge of (I hope). It seems to be a total beginners course, maybe aimed towards managers and CTOs, but I could be wrong and maybe isn't quite what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know any better alternative course for artificial intelligence in application? Should I just go for a Masters' degree in [Applied AI](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/applied-artificial-intelligence-msc-subject-to-university-approval/?i50d4274c56883)?

Artifical Intelligence 2018 Annual Report Published,3,a7kpbk,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/a7kpbk/artifical_intelligence_2018_annual_report/,3,"A team of AI experts has published the Artificial Intelligence  2018 annual report. The report outlines the growth in AI academic research, use by industry mentions by the government, patents and technical performance in computer vision, and natural language processing.  


One way to measure AI activity across different locations was by the output of academic papers. In this way, Europe was leading and made up 28 percent of AI papers last year, followed by China, which made up 25 percent, and the US at 17 percent.  


The most talked about subjects were machine learning and probabilistic learning, neural networks, and computer vision.  


What’s more, AI research in different countries was aimed at various fields, with papers from China looking at engineering, technology, and agricultural sciences, while the US and Europe looked at humanities and medical and health sciences.  


Another significant difference between countries was that in 2017 the Chinese government generated four times more AI papers than Chinese corporations, but in the US AI papers written by corporations lead the way.  


Course enrollments also reflect the growing interest in AI. In the US, registrations in introductory AI were 3.4 times more in 2017 than in 2012. During that same time, initial machine-learning enrollments (ML) grew by five times. AI and ML course enrollments at China's Tingshua University in 2017 were 16 times greater than they were in 2010.  


Downloads of robot software have also taken off around the world, especially in China. What’s more, China is a world leader in the number of robots that are installed and has seen a 500 percent rise since 2012. In 2017, almost 150,000 robots were introduced in China compared to less than 50,000 in North America.  


The report also highlights mentions of ML and AI in Canadian and UK parliaments, in addition to remarks in the US Congressional Record. From 1995 to 2015, there were fewer than 25 mentions of the technology each year in US Congress. In 2018 there were 100 mentions. In the UK, the technologies were hardly mentioned until 2015, while in 2018 mentions soared to almost 300.  


Moreover, the report tracks the human-level performance milestones of AI. In 1997 IBM's DeepBlue beat chess champion Gary Kasparov, and in 2011 IBM Watson won Jeopardy. In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo beat leading Go player Lee Sedol. And in 2018, a DeepMind agent reached human-level performance in a 3D multiplayer first-person game, Quake III Arena Capture the Flag.  


Notably absent from the report is an analysis of the military use of AI and government spending on the technology. As remarked by UNSW Sydney AI researcher Toby Walsh, some governments such as the UK, France, and Germany have committed billions to AI. Walsh would like a breakdown of investments by country in addition to the use of AI by the military.",1545238173.0,2018-12-19 11:49:33
"If AI is going to be the world’s doctor, it needs better textbooks",69,9di700,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/9di700/if_ai_is_going_to_be_the_worlds_doctor_it_needs/,12,"A 2016 [meta-analysis](https://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759) looking at 2,511 studies from around the world found that 81% of participants in genome-mapping studies were of European descent. This has severe real-world impacts: Researchers who download publicly-available data to study disease are far more likely to use the genomic data of people of European descent than those of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern descent.

Shockingly, that 81% is actually an improvement. Alice Popejoy, now a postdoc at Stanford University, was a co-author of the 2016 study. She started the analysis after repeatedly hearing lectures citing a 2009 [study](https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(09)00185-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0168952509001851%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) that had found that 96% of participants in genome-mapping studies were of European descent. “It’s not just an ethical or moral problem, it’s really a scientific problem,” says Popejoy.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/44t6cctc6mk11.png

That’s because efforts to mine these flawed datasets for use in clinical settings are proliferating. Deep Genomics, for example, is developing new treatments for [Mendelian disorders](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mendelian-genetics-patterns-of-inheritance-and-single-966) like Huntington’s disease and cystic fibrosis. Sophia Genetics is [integrating with hospitals](https://www.sophiagenetics.com/hospitals.html#sophia-ddm) to analyze patient genomes and give on-site diagnoses. IBM Watson has [touted](https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/oncology-and-genomics/genomics/) genomics as a kind of silver bullet against cancer, allowing physicians (in theory) to personalize treatment like never before.

But the missing demographic chunks of information in genetic datasets could scuttle these potential AI-based tools by rendering them about as good as guesswork. “The big takeaway is that we don’t know what we don’t know,” says Popejoy. Without knowing about variations between populations, she says, we can’t really say what the implications of those variations are on treatment.

Artificial Expert Intelligence (AXI),0,9fxvu9,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/9fxvu9/artificial_expert_intelligence_axi/,1,"Question: how many of you have wondered about the current day capabilities of artificial intelligence? How many of you would say that AI circa autumn 2018 can accomplish many tasks at once but lacks generality? And how many would say DeepMind is the closest to creating AGI because AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol and Ke Jie? Or maybe Siri or IBM Watson? 


Time for a reality check: current AI is *not* close to generality. Artificial intelligence is squarely narrow and incapable of accomplishing any task beyond its hardcoded parameters. The ability of present day AI to appear more capable than it is speaks more to the geniuses who programmed it than the networks themselves. Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Google Home, etc. are not one algorithm. They're bundles of narrow AIs that work together loosely. Not even like a brain, but more like how a clock requires many separate parts to tell time. Voice synthesis are the numbers; internet search abilities are the hands; understanding speech and all the convolutional matrices are the clockwork inside. 

This is what AI is like right now. What's more, DeepMind and OpenAI are the bleeding edge, the stuff that actually *is* AI and not scripts or tree searches. Even they will tell you that the real magic is behind the keyboard, not in the computer. 

But what if I also told you that we genuinely are on the cusp of magic? DeepMind's AlphaZero was but a single taste of the future. 

All AI today may be narrow, but some are narrower than others. 

The missing link in AI is the architecture that lies between artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). I call this missing link ""artificial expert intelligence"" or AXI. This will be the point where magic lies both within the computer and the programmer. A stage where AI displays traits of generality in certain areas. There will be no illusions and clever tricks like there are today. Artificial expert intelligence (AXI), sometimes referred to as “less-narrow AI”, refers to software that is capable of accomplishing multiple tasks in a relatively narrow field. This type of AI is new, having become possible only in the past five years due to parallel computing and deep neural networks. The best example is DeepMind’s AlphaZero, which utilized a general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithm to conquer three separate board games— chess, go, and shogi. Normally, you would require three separate networks, one for each game, but with AXI, you are able to play a wider variety of games with a single network. Thus, it is more generalized than any ANI. However, AlphaZero is not capable of playing any game. It also likely would not function if pressed to do something unrelated to game playing, such as baking a cake or business analysis. This is why it is its own category of artificial intelligence— too general for narrow AI, but too narrow for general AI. It is more akin to an expert in a particular field, knowledgeable across multiple domains without being a polymath. This is the next step of machine learning, the point at which transfer learning and deep reinforcement learning allow for computers to understand certain things without needing to be mechanically fed rules and capable of expanding its own hyperparameters.

What are the (rational) arguments against the possibilities of creating AGI?,6,2r602s,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/2r602s/what_are_the_rational_arguments_against_the/,31,"I just finished How to Create a Mind by Kurzweil, can highly recommend it. He discusses a few objections, but I'm sure there are some a bit more sophisticated that he left out.

So what are reasons AGI and artificial consciousness can not be created?

The ones I have so far (including a very simple counter argument) is:

**Our brains do something outside of the laws of physics and have some magical capability (like a soul) that cannot be artificially reproduced.**  
This is magical thinking. Considering everything else in the world is bound by causality (except possibly qantum mechanics), it's strange to think that the human brain would've somehow created some magical property allowing us to be conscious. 

**The Brain is too complex to simuate.**  
With all the research on the brain and the neocortex specifically we see that all our memories, learned skills, ideas, speech recognition, visual processing and whatnot use a very similar structure in the brain. A good example of this is that when part of the brain becomes damaged, let's say the speech portion of the neocortex, the brain will still be able to learn to speak, as it will just use another part of the brain.

**A computer will never truly 'understand' anything. / Searle's Chinese room experiment**  
If we look at Watson and the way he thinks, it's a form of statistical analyses of a large data set stored hierarchically. That is pretty much exactly what our brain does. So if Watson doesn't understand puns, than we don't either. (He wouldn't find them funny tho)  
While the man in the room may never understand Chinese, the system does. The man combined with the manual for processing incoming letters forms the system. Saying the man doesn't understand Chinese is like saying a single neuron never understands English. 

**Our cells are quantum computing and that can never be replicated in computers**  
Both parts of this argument are false. There's nothing to suggest our brains do any actual quantum computing. It's a leap of faith to assume that. Also, the things the brain does don't require quantum computing to do it. The second part is, there's absolutely no reason to suggest that we couldn't replicate quantum computing in machines.

https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/what-is-artificial-intelligence/518547/

In it the author quotes a guy who defines AI in the following way:

""Isbell suggests two features necessary before a system deserves the name AI. First, it must learn over time in response to changes in its environment. Fictional robots and cyborgs do this invisibly, by the magic of narrative abstraction. But even a simple machine-learning system like Netflix’s dynamic optimizer, which attempts to improve the quality of compressed video, takes data gathered initially from human viewers and uses it to train an algorithm to make future choices about video transmission.

Isbell’s second feature of true AI: what it learns to do should be interesting enough that it takes humans some effort to learn. It’s a distinction that separates artificial intelligence from mere computational automation. A robot that replaces human workers to assemble automobiles isn’t an artificial intelligence, so much as machine programmed to automate repetitive work. For Isbell, “true” AI requires that the computer program or machine exhibit self-governance, surprise, and novelty.""

I'm sure the definition might be up for debate, but what's the most advanced AI out there on the market?  Or which company is on the right track towards real AI (they might not be the most advanced yet)?

I understand the basic difference between Google DeepMind and Watson.  Are they the gold standards right now?  Or are they only really capable of applying AI to very specific use cases?",1492827981.0,2017-04-21 22:26:21
One thing that bugs me about Alex Wissner-Gross theory,20,1sv3ul,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1sv3ul/one_thing_that_bugs_me_about_alex_wissnergross/,29,"When I first rred about Wissner-Gross theory of intelligence, I was fascinated and impressed by the small demos of his software called entropica.   But I was also immediately a bit skeptical about ""intelligence"" being the correct word to describe what it achieved.  I had the feeling his software was more about being ""alive"" than being ""intelligent"".

At around the same time, I happened to watch a video on YouTube with [a smart toddler questioning why people eat meat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHV2hzfz7QU).   I won't argue with a five-year-old about food policies, but I just want to mention one thing the kid said at around 2:00, that I couldn't help relate to AWG's theory:

>  I like them to be standing up

That immediately reminded me of the demo where entropica is given a rigid rod and when the software chose to continuously balance it vertically.  It preferred it that way, because it was the configuration with the highest long term entropy, if I understand correctly.

That's how I started to think that what AWG nailed out with his equation is not really intelligence, but rather life in some way.

I mean, it's true that the question of what intelligence is has been puzzling scientists and philosophers for quite some time, but so has the question of what life is.  Since Darwin, some people thought that the mystery was solved:  life is what is capable of reproduction and evolution, in a nutshell.   But careful analysis seems to indicate that things are not so simple.   Moreover, it doesn't seem to fit our colloquial, intuitive conception of what is life, or rather what is ""alive"".

Think about Dr.  Frankenstein at the exact moment when he shouted ""IT'S ALIVE!!"", talking about his creature.  He didn't say that because he witnessed the creature reproducing and evolving.   He did say that simply because he saw the creature move and do stuff.

There is an old, quite esoteric concept called ""life force"" that we used to attribute to all living things.   Although it is not a scientific, rigorously defined notion, it does nail our intuitive idea of something being alive as being animated with some kind of inner power and tendency to action.  Life seems to magically do stuff, seemingly out of nowhere.  A seed looks very much like a small piece of dirt or rock, and yet when you put it in a wet soil, somehow a green stem grows and climbs up to the sky.  Of course there are reasons for that, from a bio-chemistry and bio-mechanical point, but from an external point of view, it could seem mysterious and ""life"" is the word we tend to use to name whatever hides behind this mystery.

It seems to me that ""being alive"" is an important, overlooked subject of reflection for artificial intelligence.  Consider IBM's Watson, for instance.  I have the feeling this machine is quite intelligent.  After all, it can solve puzzles much faster than I could.  And it's not always about having a bigger memory and knowledge.  Quite often enigmas in Jeopardy require nothing but common sense knowledge, but the trick is to associate the correct answer with the right question.

Yet, even if Watson is arguably intelligent, it seems to me that it's a dead machine.   It only does stuff that it's been programmed to.   The way it *thinks* is the result of machine learning, but not the way it *acts*.   It only presses the button because it's been programmed to.  It has no ""inner motivation"" to play.   It does not play because it thinks this will give a higher long term entropy.

That's the point I'm trying to make:  AWG's theory is great to find purpose for a machine, but it's less clear whether it can help finding out how this machine can work.  For instance, I don't see how AWG's theory could help designing a memory system, or how the machine could build a representation of the world.   I seems to me that for entropica to work, it must be given this representation of the world.  Only then it is capable of evaluating causal-entropies.

Sometimes intelligence is loosely described as ""the ability to solve problems"".  But who decides what is a problem?   Who recognizes when there is a problem to be solved?   Ask a question to a strong AI machine, what does guarantee you that the machine will even consider giving you the answer, even if it knows it?  How can you be sure that it will be willing to collaborate, or even just interact with you?  To do so you need to understand the way the machine *acts* and why it does so, not just the way the machine *thinks*.

If intelligence is the ability to solve problems, it seems to me that AWG's theory is what can help define what a problem is.  It gives purpose and volition to a machine.

"Direction for personal research into bottlenecks of logic programming, knowledge representation and expert systems.",19,1lrqn7,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1lrqn7/direction_for_personal_research_into_bottlenecks/,17,"Originally I was drawn to A.I. by an interest in adaptive neural networks.  My expectation was to study basic control theory and use a N.N. to improve performance of quadcoptors, prosthetics, etc through learning.  My reading brought me to an NLP experiment involving the grouping of words as concepts by crawling Wikipedia and taking context into account.  The illustration of the work was similar to a projection from a support vector machine.

Neural Network folks are always claiming that the bottlenecks are in the architecture, and this seems to be reinforced by IBM's efforts and by Andrew Ng's recent attempts at creating specialized hardware.  I put these studies on hold to strengthen my foundations and to get a lay of the land, lest I turn into an uninformed evangelist.

After some exposure to Prolog and predicate logic (as well as CSP and SAT solvers) I'm beginning to see some beauty in symbolic logic programming.  I believe this is used to some degree in IBM's Watson as well.  I'm told that on common architectures the combinatorial explosion outside of toy problems proves overwhelming, and parallelism is paramount.

**Which paradigms of parallel and/or distributed computing are candidates for addressing these bottlenecks, both in symbolic A.I. and in sub-symbolic approaches?**

Can intelligence be dead (and thus safe)?,2,27uyl0,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/27uyl0/can_intelligence_be_dead_and_thus_safe/,20,"These days I think a bit about artificial intelligence and whether or not it can represent a danger for mankind.  It's a tough question, but lately I think I found an angle that makes things a bit clearer in my mind.  Basically the idea is that it seems to me that we should worry more about *artificial life* than about *artificial intelligence*, and we should make more effort into clearly separating those two concepts.

I've discussed on [an other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1sv3ul/one_thing_that_bugs_me_about_alex_wissnergross/) some of my reserves about Alex Wissner-Gross's theory of intelligence.  I won't discussed it again in details but the gist is that I think AWG is up to something with his idea but that it is not exactly intelligence.  What he describes is something important but he picked the wrong word to name it imho.  It's at least as much about life or something in between.  As a matter of fact one thing I've learnt thanks to this thread is that there are theories about a continuity between life and intelligence.  I haven't quite delved into it but it did inspire my later reflections.

It's a tough idea to explain, and maybe I'm not quite ready to put it into words now but I'll try anyway.  Basically I have the feeling that it is possible for something to be intelligent and yet be ""dead"".  Reciprocally it is possible to be alive and yet be totally not intelligent.  And in between there is a full spectrum.   And I now tend to think that if we want to create a safe AGI, we have to make sure it is dead.  It is not a sufficient condition, since even dead things (like a gun or bomb) can be dangerous, but I believe it is necessary :  I suspect any form of living AGI would cause mankind's demise.

Now I guess I should describe what I mean by *intelligence* and what I mean by *alive*, and obviously this is going to be delicate as those concepts are difficult to define and there is no consensus about them.

Intelligence is often described as a capacity, an aptitude to do things such as solve problems, realize goals or ""maximize the future entropy"" as AWG would say.  In other words, intelligence seems to be assumed as being a characteristic of a living being (something that does stuff).  This nags me a bit:  I think we tend to mix and confuse those two concepts, maybe simply because all intelligent things we know are living beings (basically humans and animals).  But are they really?

Is a calculator intelligent?  Most people would say no.  And yet we call our mobile phones ""smartphones"".  Those machines are not intelligent, but there is some intelligence into them, at the very least in the way they are designed.  They also can do stuff I surely can not do (crushing numbers).  I'm not saying they are as intelligent or more intelligent than a human being.  But they are, at least a tiny bit, representative of what is intelligence.  If being intelligent is being able to do intelligent things, the part about intelligence in this description is not about ""doing"" but rather about the ""intelligent things"".   The part about doing is the part about being alive, about doing stuff.

If you get rid of the part about doing stuff, what is left are the intelligent actions which stop being actions and become just events (because you want to ignore the fact that they emerged from a decision).  What is left is a model of the external environment, which reflects it and thus allow to predict what will happen.   A calculator implements a model of algebra and can thus perform complex computation, *provided a living agent makes it do so*.

A supercomputer solving Navier-Stokes equations to predict weather has some intelligence in it.  But since it's just a machine that has no volition, no free-will and would basically do nothing if there is not a programmer to tell it to do something, it is a completely dead system and thus can not be considered ""intelligent"".  It can not really ""solve"" anything because it does not ""act"".  Yet without it a human being is not able to solve the equations to predict weather.   My point is that I believe it is a form of intelligence that is dead, and that it is the kind of intelligence that can be relatively safe for mankind (by this I mean as safe as an atomic bomb :  because no matter how dangerous an atomic bomb is, it is not designed to explode by itself, it needs a human to press the button).

An other example is Watson.  Lots of people deny it is any advancement in artificial intelligence.  I think it is, but still it is very much a dead machine, and I believe that's why people are reluctant to consider it as ""intelligent"", because we tend to confuse or mix the idea of being intelligent and being alive.

There is currently a lot of work made to create a machine capable of identifying objects.  These machines are just classifiers.  Basically you give an input image and you get an output which classifies the object on the image.  Those machines can hardly be described as intelligent as they are merely data filters.  Yet what they do is crucial for what we describe as intelligent behavior and even consciousness.   Imagine now that the same kind of machine was capable of classifying more abstract notions, like motions and actions (walking, holding, sleeping...), and after that even more abstract concepts (sound, euphemism, art...).  At some point the machine would have created a whole model of the world in all its subtleties and with this machine a living operator could solve problems : he would describe the problems with the terms defined in the model, and then run various simulations until he find the expected result.  Exactly like with a calculator except it would not be limited to algebra but could process any problem that fits into the model of the World.   To me this ""machine"" would still be dead and yet it would be hard for me not to consider that this machine has some intelligence into it.

What's a good starting place to learn more about spatial and temporal reasoning,6,13r913,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/13r913/whats_a_good_starting_place_to_learn_more_about/,4,"I've read that Watson had special code for this type of reasoning as does the Cyc engine and I wondered if anyone could point to me to any papers or books that give an introduction to this type of reasoning.

I don't know much about it but I'm coming at from a symbol based prolog type understanding, where some of the facts would only be true for certain durations, places or times. So if there's anything that uses that as a basis so much the better!",1353871555.0,2012-11-25 14:25:55
"questions about AI, evolution, etc",0,1tuujd,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1tuujd/questions_about_ai_evolution_etc/,2,"i have some general questions about evolution and AI

currently what is the bottleneck with AI? is it hardware or software? probably hardware i assume, but what impact does software have?

could we develop, maybe even at the beginning a very low intelligence (like that of an insect or something) that would constantly be improving itself? now i have to make a sharp distinction between ""Watson"" the IBM computer who keeps adding information to his knowledge - i don't mean doing that. i mean improving the way it gets and understands knowledge, that would be evolution. i don't know whether this would be hardware or software or both. could we develop something that would evolve much faster than biological life? 

which of these two areas in your opinion should a prospective scientist go into, and which should the scientific community be allocating more resources (essentially which is higher priority in your opinion), fully understanding the brain, consciousness, being able to IE save our memories and back them up, maybe even upload consciousness, OR developing intelligence to surpass human intelligence? which goal is better for us and the future in your opinion

are there any proposals or theories as to how in general an intelligence could possibly be programmed? like how the programming language would work? what programming language is the most sophisticated/effective currently?

(in the following question, for some cases good=altruistic and evil=selfish) is it the scientific community's consensus that intelligence, in general, leads to good, evil, or we don't know? since we only have lesser intelligences to compare to, and i have to say, humans have done a lot more evil shit than any or all animals... in this train of thought, what about insects? are they more altruistic or selfish? if they are more selfish, could it be a pattern of good-evil-good-evil as intelligence rises (or falls) or is this way off



i hope these make sense. thanks",1388233813.0,2013-12-28 07:30:13
How long until computers replace lawyers?,0,1t61rj,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1t61rj/how_long_until_computers_replace_lawyers/,1,"After medicine, I suspect IBM's Watson will tackle Law practice.   It seems to be a perfect job for it.  Law is made of large amount of unstructured data, and the main job of a lawyer is to analyse this data and apply it for a particular case.  Also, it's a job that can pay very well when it's well done.  So there's a big incentive to work on it.

Assuming IBM needs about ten years to turn Watson into a fully capable doctor, I'd bet they'll need about just as much to turn it into a lawyer.

So, I'd say twenty years at most.",1387404455.0,2013-12-18 17:07:35
