Welcome to /r/artificial!,127,6i91sh,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/6i91sh/welcome_to_rartificial/,16,"/r/artificial is the largest subreddit dedicated to all issues related to Artificial Intelligence or AI. What does that mean? That is actually a tricky question, as the definition of AI is a topic of hot debate among people both inside and outside of the field. Broadly speaking, it is about machines that behave intelligently in some way, but this means different things to different people. 

Most notably, there is the distinction between machines that are (at least) as intelligent as humans (artificial general intelligence / AGI) and machines that are capable of performing one task very well that would require intelligence if a human did it (narrow AI / ANI). When people outside the field think of ""AI"", they often think of AGI and possibly very humanlike AGI, often inspired by sci-fi books, shows and movies. However, today we are unable to create such systems. What we *can* do is create magnificently useful software and robotic tools, and that is what most of the professional AI field does. So to most professionals ""AI"" tends to refer to ANI. This can lead to a lot of confusion. 

Another important thing to realize is that AI is an incredibly broad field that touches on Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Mathematics, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Linguistics and many others, and includes many subfields like Machine Learning, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Knowledge-Based Systems, Evolutionary Algorithms, Search and Planning. Many of these have subreddits dedicated to them as well (see [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/related-subreddits)). /r/artificial is about all of these things. For instance, posts about computer vision are very welcome here, although the poster should realize people here will have a broader AI background than the specialists on /r/computervision, which might affect the kind of discussion that emerges. 

On /r/artificial we welcome anyone who is interested in intelligent and respectful discussion of AI in any form. We want to provide a low barrier of entry, specifically because there are so many misconceptions about AI. We do ask that you put in a little effort before posting. Check out our burgeoning [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/index) and [Wikipedia's article on AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) to appreciate the breadth of the field. When you ask a question, [do so intelligently](http://www.wikihow.com/Ask-a-Question-Intelligently). When you post a story, prefer balanced discussion to clickbait, and please seek out the original source (many website just copy each others' stories without attribution). When you post a paper, please link to where it can be (legally) obtained for free and ideally to the landing page rather than directly to a PDF. Also consider jumpstarting the discussion with your own insights, questions, additional links and/or a short summary for people outside the niche the article was written for. 

Please use this thread for suggestions, comments and questions *about* this subreddit.

"Automation of Accountants (and related jobs, i.e. auditors)",1,c06fj7,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/c06fj7/automation_of_accountants_and_related_jobs_ie/,0,"Going to graduate soon with a Bachelor Degree in Accounting. But I am worried if I have made the right decision.

​

According to this often-quoted research paper from Oxford University ([https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/.../The\_Future\_of\_Employment.pdf](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)), it seems that accountants/auditors has a whopping 94% chances of getting automated. Indeed, this is very scary and worrying.

​

Now obviously I don't want to find myself getting sacked because of automation when I am in my 30s or 40s which is considered to be at prime age of career. It would be very hard for me to learn a new trade/skills by then to change my career track.

​

Is this automation threat, as described in the research, is true as accountants/auditors jobs are concerned? Am I going to lose my job in the near future?

​

I am also worried of the automation threat, considering the growth of cryptos/blockchain technology. Correct me if I am wrong, but blockchain technology are, according to my understanding, designed to be automation-friendly and does not requires audit due to its transparent and irreversible nature, and tampering with the transactions data are virtually impossible.

​

What sort of programming/computing skills that I should acquire to keep myself competitive? Python? SQL? R?

​

Or, should I just stay away from this line of jobs from the very beginning and start off my career with other jobs, i.e. IT auditors, internal auditors, consultants or even data scientist and programmers? But then there will be no turning back for me......sort of like a gamble.",1560464563.0,2019-06-13 18:22:43

Did I accidentally invent something?,55,bzqmg8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqmg8/did_i_accidentally_invent_something/,7,"I just noticed that I have been successfully using a regularization technique for Gradient Boosting Trees for years, but its wikipedia page doesn't list it ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\_boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)) and I can't find it on Google.

&#x200B;

Can someone tell me if this is already known, but under a name I didn't search for, or if it's actually new?

&#x200B;

The idea is this:

&#x200B;

Before training a set of Gradient Boosted Trees, enhance your input data by adding a bunch of new features with completely random values. Since these new features are random, there is no real correlation between them and the output.

&#x200B;

When you train the system with gradient boosting, it will sometimes create Trees that make use of these random features. Whenever this happens, you know for sure that this is a case of overfitting, since those features are completely random. So you can just go ahead and delete that Tree and stop the gradient boosting.

&#x200B;

This technique can also be adapted for Random Forests.

&#x200B;

You can also adapt it for any other machine learning models that allow you to quantify how large the impact of a feature is: Any time that one of the random features has a larger impact than one of the actual features, you can assume you are overfitting. Unlike decision trees it's sometimes non-trivial to remove the dummy features from the trained model, though, which you need to do to make it usable during testing.",1560371369.0,2019-06-12 16:29:29

Thesis about the potential of AI for Train Traffic Control,3,bzqwyu,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzqwyu/thesis_about_the_potential_of_ai_for_train/,4,"Hello r/artificial community, this is my first post, as I'm still fairly new to the topic of AI. My name is Marius and I am a German business informatics student in my last semester and sadly AI and ML have not really been a topic dealt with in university.

As the title says, I am currently writing my bachelors thesis about the potential of using AI for Train Traffic Control (TTC). I have been following the advancements of AI for complex problems, especially AlphaGo, AlphaZero, AlphaStar, and OpenAI Five for a while now. Those advancements are very impressive, however industrial applications that use this potential are still scarce. In particular, in the transportation sector, for planning, scheduling, and other logistics tasks, I see a huge potential.

Naturally, a long development and testing process would be needed for a real-world application of AI in this domain.  Would an autonomous system for planning and dispatching trains be accepted, allowed and safe? May it can be even more safe, increase capacity and reduce delays? Those are things that need to be looked at. 

&#x200B;

I am looking for experts for interviews about their views on AI for TTC and the cutting edge of AI usage in rail environments.

If you are an AI and/or security expert, especially in the transportation environment and have the time and willingness to be interviewed I would really appreciate if you contact me.

&#x200B;

Sadly the timetable for my thesis is very strict and I only have a few weeks left and I don't have a lot of connections, which makes it more difficult to find experts. I am sorry if I am still a little naive about the topic of AI, which will hopefully improve as I keep working on it.

Should there be anything you want more information or specifics about, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.

[Brainstorming] Requirements for an AI that's simply fun to hang out with,0,bzm3t8,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bzm3t8/brainstorming_requirements_for_an_ai_thats_simply/,1,"Hey fellow researchers, programmers, and all others involved in the discussions on AI topics.

I was about to start programming an AI framework, that was meant to supply the basic functionality to run an AI, that's fun to hang out with. Some persona-like thing, that you would enjoy having around, when you open your beer (or coke) after work, when reading the newspaper, or even on a jam session or boardgame night with your friends.

I - very soon, basically at the very beginning - did run into severe trouble though: What the heck are those things, that would make an AI fun to hang out with? 

One might think about what makes humans fun to hang out with, and try to simulate their behaviour. But my guess would be, that this approach is doomed, and not necessarily the only valid one: We can very well imagine having fun with an AI, that is vastly different from humans.

&#x200B;

What I came up with so far:

The AI should be able to...

... memorize your preferences

... memorize the relationships between different persons it knows

... tell you random side facts, roughly related to your prefered topics

... sing!

... play boardgames. At least chess and such.

... build associative phrases to some kind of lyrical input

... draw?

... tell contextualized (yea, this may be hard, but at least to a certain degree) good bad jokes.

... to contest statements you make and make fun of how inconsistent ""softlings"" are.

&#x200B;

I feel like there is plenty missing, especially some kind of continuing link between all of those things. I'd be glad if you could help me brainstorming on that issue.",1560338700.0,2019-06-12 07:25:00

But since a while, the moderators are concerned about so called low quality postings.[1] The interesting point is, that only questions are judged as created by spam-bots [2] but never the answers in the forum. This allows to maintain a self-understanding, in which the forum itself works great but only the bad educated environment isn't able to ask the right questions.

In the literature about the inner working of social systems, such a behavior is called self-oriented. It's equal to a closed-system which is trying to protect itself against threats from the outside world by defining legitimate requests as spam.

Has anyone taken Oxford Artificial Intelligence Programme (or a better alternative)?,13,bxsq9n,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bxsq9n/has_anyone_taken_oxford_artificial_intelligence/,2,"Hello,

I studied and graduated Computer Science back in 2007, I actually chose a lot of electives on AI and even wrote my thesis on NLP and my university (University of Sussex) was and still is relatively well known for its research in the field.

&#x200B;

I've never used AI in my work (I've worked primarily in legal and property) to any great degree until the last two years. I've been using TensorFlow, Watson and other tools to create and use existing classifiers to good effect.

&#x200B;

The field has moved on a fair amount since I was an undergraduate and I was thinking about taking a short-course over the summer, so I can move into a field that I was truly passionate about as an undergrad that people now are seemingly climbing over themselves to get applicative knowledge in.

Has anyone here personally [taken the course](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/oxford-artificial-intelligence-programme)? If so did it go beyond the conceptual, which I already have a fairly good working knowledge of (I hope). It seems to be a total beginners course, maybe aimed towards managers and CTOs, but I could be wrong and maybe isn't quite what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know any better alternative course for artificial intelligence in application? Should I just go for a Masters' degree in [Applied AI](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/applied-artificial-intelligence-msc-subject-to-university-approval/?i50d4274c56883)?

Any alternative options gladly welcomed.",1559930137.0,2019-06-07 13:55:37
